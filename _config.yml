Ott was an avid amateur photographer who amassed over 10,000 slides, prints, and negatives spanning the years from 1883 to 1990. The digital collection represents a selection from Ott's whole collection, which he compiled into eleven albums containing a total of over 1,800 images of Moscow and surrounding Latah County and used to educate local citizens."
