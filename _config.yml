The disease reached the University of Idaho in October of that year, prompting the university to cancel activities, enact a quarantine, and encourage the use of gauze face masks. The 1918 Flu Pandemic Collection brings together correspondence, reports, news articles, oral histories, and other materials that highlight the local response to the 1918 pandemic."
