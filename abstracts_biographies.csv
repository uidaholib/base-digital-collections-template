"burnett","Colloquium Talk, November 6, 2013, Idaho Commons","Director, Martin Institute and International Studies.","In a society governed by the rule of law, rather than by the mere preferences of 
powerful individuals, the law must embody principles broad enough to be coherent, specific enough to be effective, and flexible enough to cope with the pressures of social and technological change. Early Western jurisprudence was characterized by a search for immutable truths drawn from antiquity or revealed through ecclesiastical study. During the late Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution, immutability yielded to utilitarianism – promoting the ""greatest good for the greatest number – as the highest object of the law. In the mid-nineteenth century, utilitarianism evolved, or devolved, into positivism (a view that the law, having no conceptual anchor, is nothing more than a set of enforceable commands), followed by sociological jurisprudence (which treated law primarily as a process by which social forces are expressed and accommodated), and then, in the twentieth century, by ""realism"" (which reprised the positivist idea that law simply expresses power and cannot be expected to constrain it). This synthesis of law and power proved unsatisfactory. The Holocaust, the emergence of murderously despotic regimes in Europe 
and Asia, and the devastation wreaked by a second world-wide war, all contributed a rejection of rootless law. The jurisprudential pendulum swung back to a search for legal principles and institutions -- exemplified by the codification of universal human rights 
and the creation of war crimes tribunals – that would shape and sustain a durable commitment to the rule of law.

This search, which continues to the present day, has advanced along many intellectual paths, two of which will be examined here: (1) the articulation of general principles of ethical behavior in the learned professions, such as the practice of law, coupled with situation-specific guides to appropriate conduct; and (2) the ""law and economics movement,"" which seeks to develop principles to advance the oft-competing goals of efficiency and equity, and to provide methods for gauging the actual impacts of statutes, regulations, and judicial decisions in particular contexts. In this ""Humanities Exploration"" program, prominent milestones along each intellectual path will be examined, and members of the audience will be challenged to think about howtheywould create a set of principles that do not merely evince their own personal preferences, but rather are sufficiently coherent, specific, and flexible to identify a general concept of justice, to achieve it in specific cases, and to stand the test of time.","Don Burnett's career has encompassed service as an appellate judge, practicing lawyer, JAG officer, state bar president, law dean, and law professor. Born at Pocatello, Idaho, in 1946, he received his baccalaureate degree magna cum laude in economics from Harvard, his J.D. degree from the University of Chicago, and an LL.M. degree from the University of Virginia. He also graduated on the ""Commandant's List"" from the Command & General Staff College of the U.S. Army. As a reserve officer in the Army Judge Advocate General's Corps, Don's service included the position of reserve deputy commandant and academic director of The Judge Advocate General's School in Charlottesville, Virginia. He received the U.S. Armed Forces Legion of Merit award for career achievements when he retired with the rank of Colonel in 2001.

Don's concurrent civilian career began with service as a law clerk to the Chief Justice of the Idaho Supreme Court and as an assistant attorney general for the State of Idaho. He entered private practice in Pocatello and practiced with B. Lynn Winmill (currently Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho). He became president of the Idaho State Bar; chaired the Bar's professional conduct standards committee; served by contract as a judge of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribal Court; and served as executive director of the Idaho Judicial Council. In 1982, he was appointed to the Idaho Court of Appeals by Governor John V. Evans, and he was retained in office by statewide election (unopposed) in 1986.

In 1990 Don accepted the University of Louisville's appointment as dean of the law school now named, through efforts by Don and his colleagues, for the school's historic and visionary benefactor: Justice Louis D. Brandeis. Don served twelve years on the faculty, including ten years as dean. In addition to his academic work in Louisville, he chaired the Ethics Committee of the Kentucky Bar Association as well as the State Judiciary Policy Council of the Kentucky Center for Public Issues. He served as the convening member of the Kentucky Roundtable on the Environment and the Economy. He was a member of the board and the executive committee of Health Kentucky, Inc. (a nonprofit organization devoted to improving healthcare for the poor).","<p>In a society governed by the rule of law, rather than by the mere preferences of

understanding of an ancient theme:  How to govern in accord with 
constitutional and legal principles (considered universal and perennial) while 
addressing emergencies (considered idiosyncratic and immediate) that escape or 
defy law.  It's a problem that gripped the ancient Athenians as well as the 
Romans, and it has been a subject of enduring interest in the Anglo-Saxon world 
of law.  Indeed, it has absorbed the wit and energy of scholars and 
statesmen for centuries.  It is a familiar subject to Americans who, since 
our founding, have faced emergencies that have outrun the law.  It became a 
prominent issue during the Cold War, as presidents and their supporters urged 
unbridled executive power to confront the Soviet bogeyman.  Since 9/11, the 
issue of the scope of presidential power has become the issue of the season, as 
presidents and their champions have urged the removal of restraints from the 
exercise of executive power.  We find the arguments in the Torture Memos 
and in the rationales invoked by the Obama Administration.  So, this is a 
theme that resounds across the centuries and represents philosophical, 
political, legal and constitutional questions of great moment for the republic.  
Among others, we may raise the question:  Is it possible to suspend 
liberties in times of crisis in order to preserve the nation without 
surrendering American Constitutionalism?  Can those liberties, once 
sacrificed, be restored?  Can we save Democracy through un-Democratic

workshop, while providing participants with a few of the general principles in 
Ghanaian music and dance, is designed to reveal the context of music in Ghanaian 
society. Like most music making communities throughout the world, Ghanaian music 
is organized as a social event carrying with it both hierarchical and 
egalitarian standards and implications. However, what is found in Ghanaian tradition, perhaps more so than 
standards in Euro-USA traditions, is a much thinner boundary between audience 
and performers. Public performances taking place on social occasions are highly 
participatory with little-to-no passivity on the part of spectators. In the 
Ghanaian spirit ofAkwaaba(English 
translation: ""you're welcome""), when members of a community come together for 
the purposes of festival, ceremony, or recreational activities ethnic group 
members are generally expected to participate (whether it be direct involvement 
with the music or dance). The Ewe 
Name Dance is a fitting example of the participatory nature of Ghanaian music 
and dance. As a recreational activity, this dance takes place under the light 
and coolness of the overhead moon when the community's youth are finished with 
daily chores. In learning this dance, 
participants will quickly experience a number of features that typify West 
African music and dance: call-and-response, bilateral and symmetrical motion, 
and polyrhythm. These elements of 
the practice provide an unceasing natural, contemplative, and entertaining 
groove. It can be noted that while this is a relatively simple dance, it 
contains elements that, when imbued with spiritual and ritualistic practices, 
become the vehicle for the trance and possession found in West African 
traditional religions.

In your 
""welcomed participation"" in the unique and idiosyncratic elements of Ghanaian 
music and dance we will have an opportunity to transcend the differences and 
share in our common humanity.","Barry T. Bilderback is an assistant professor of music history and

momentum of life. From the political perspective, the hub is ""us,"" here and 
now ... ourselves as individuals, the ""we"" of our communities, the factions and 
composite of a nation, a generation of people. The spokes are our experiences 
and connections to each other over generations, spanning disciplines, across 
neighborhoods, countries, and continents, the temporal nature of being ... the 
ultimate of mobile networking. The rim in this model is the wholeness of being, 
the collective impacts of existence, the planetary ecosystem that supports us,

For more information:Rodney Frey","<p>As I contemplated Rodney Frey's tantalizing invitation to join this humanities 
exploration, with its symbolic wheel hub, rim, and spokes symbolism, I got stuck 
on the image of a wheel as a static horizontal shape. Wheels move. They roll. 
They are integral parts of the vehicles that transport us. They are part of the 
momentum of life. From the political perspective, the hub is ""us,"" here and 
now ... ourselves as individuals, the ""we"" of our communities, the factions and 
composite of a nation, a generation of people. The spokes are our experiences 
and connections to each other over generations, spanning disciplines, across 
neighborhoods, countries, and continents, the temporal nature of being ... the 
ultimate of mobile networking. The rim in this model is the wholeness of being, 
the collective impacts of existence, the planetary ecosystem that supports us, 
and the emotional, social, and spiritual blanket that swaddles all.
Accordingly, I will focus on life's 
journeys, incremental destinations, and some of the traveling companions who 
influence policies, places, and our future.</p>","<p>

"deyasi","Colloquium Talk, October 4, 2011, Idaho Commons","Assistant Professor of Art and Design","In the late nineteenth-century, artists like Paul 
Gauguin famously traveled the globe hoping to find a primitive refuge from the 
modern world. But what was he looking for? What did he think he might find? The 
answers to these questions lie in the rise of Theosophy and other syncretic 
religions around the turn of the twentieth-century. Theosophy, founded in 1875, 
aimed to unite all faiths, all peoples, and all knowledge. Its adherents 
attempted to find aspects of divine truth in all religious traditions, including 
Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Theosophists believed in equality 
irrespective of race, gender, or national origin. In the context of the time, 
this was a radical, ultra-left-wing position and they were virtually alone in 
asserting it. Theosophically-inspired periodicals mixed anti-colonialism and 
anti-racism with their articles on auras, numerology, and traveling on the 
astral plane. As Leela Gandhi argued in her recent book,Affective 
Communities, this position of radical equality relied on the cultural 
politics of empathy, on the assumption that all human life was equal and 
interconnected. As a result, it corresponds to the ""wagon wheel"" model of human 
community proposed by Tom Yellowtail and Rodney Frey. While art historians have 
studied the politically conservative strands of Symbolism, few have explored the 
left-wing cultural politics of Theosophy and its French variant, Martinism, in 
the art of Gauguin and his followers among the Symbolists. In this paper, I 
analyse the art of Gauguin, Paul Ranson, Claude-Emile Schuffenecker and others 
to reveal how their art is steeped in religious and cultural syncretism. I argue 
that their art reveals both a yearning for a pre-modern golden age of human 
connection with nature and the divine, as well as the anti-colonialism and 
anti-racism that were characteristic of Theosophy and Martinism.","Marco Deyasi is the art historian at the University of Idaho.

"eigenbrode","Colloquium Talk, January 24, 2012, Idaho Commons","Professor of Chemical Ecology and Chair of Entomology.","Evidently since the inception of rigorous inquiry about the nature of the 
physical world, there has been a tension between the value of science for its 
utility vs. the value of science for deepening our understanding and 
appreciation of nature.

From Plato's Republic

Socrates:Shall we set down astronomy among the subjects of study?Glaucon:I think so, to know something about the seasons, the months and the 
years is of use for military purposes, as well as for agriculture and for 
navigation.Socrates:It amuses me to see how afraid you are, lest the 
people should accuse you of recommending useless studies.

This 
ancient tension continues to operate within every scientific discipline, whether 
one or the other perspective predominates within that discipline. Through the 
science of the enlightenment a shift can be discerned from an emphasis on 
attention to the workings of nature as a kind of intellectual devotion to an 
emphasis on understanding nature and harnessing its principles.
Post enlightenment science has shifted from an 
emphasis on fundamental curiosity to application.
My own discipline, entomology, has scholarly roots 
in cataloguing and fathoming the bewildering biological diversity of insects, 
but also in the quest to manage the species that compete with us for food and 
fiber. Americans played a central roll in elevating applied entomology, although 
some of the giants like C.V. Riley and Benjamin Walsh, were also gifted and 
insightful naturalists.

Unfortunately, 
the tension has produced a divide in contemporary science between so-called 
applied and basic university research. Sometimes the frontiers can be located on 
a map of a university campus – like the University of Idaho. Significance of 
this tension has increased in recent years, along with the need to justify 
public funding of science. The fascinating and beautiful universe revealed by 
science is accessible to us as an ancillary to applied research. Arguments for 
funding basic science have been forced to focus on the potential for basic 
science to yield, indirectly, concrete benefits in the form of better 
technology, better medicine, better agriculture, whether via the so-called 
""linear model"" or the ""fabric"" model that depends upon the interplay of basic 
and applied science (Holton et al. 1996). This tactic tends to diminish the role 
of science for helping us understand better who we are and what we are a part 
of.

In our Toolbox 
project, we have conducted over 60 workshops with more than 400 participants and 
built around responses to prompts that probe the attitudes about philosophical 
issues and assumptions of science. The first prompt states: The principal value 
of research stems from the potential application of the knowledge gained. 
Responses have ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree, with a mean that 
tends towards agreement with this statement, perhaps revealing prevalent 
attitudes. In the talk, I will examine the responses more carefully, considering 
the demographics of respondents.

Nonetheless, 
many scientists today continue to be strongly motivated by curiosity and wonder, 
as well as the need to solve problems. I am one of these, and will illustrate 
with some of my personal story. Could the motivation to pursue 'pure' science 
represent the hub and rim of the wheel that links science and the humanities?
In this view, 'applied' science becomes some or all of the many spokes of 
the wheel. But perhaps it is the other way around","Dr. Sanford D. Eigenbrode
is Professor and Chair of Entomology at the University of Idaho. He received a 
BS in biology, an MS in Natural Resources and a PhD in Entomology from Cornell 
University. Sanford conducts 
research on chemical ecology of insect-plant and multi-trophic interactions.
He has expertise in host plant resistance, natural products chemistry, 
scanning electron microscopy, and integration of host plant resistance into 
insect pest management. Recently, he has focused on the chemical ecology, 
landscape ecology and management of insect-vectored viruses of wheat, potatoes 
and legumes. He is director of an AFRI RAMP project on legume virus risk 
mitigation. His landscape ecology research has included study of insect pests 
affecting coffee agroforestry systems in Costa Rica.

Oral Tradition. Within the four principals are guidelines for ethical research--

Penney-Pinkhamis an enrolled Nimíipuu and a proud 5th grade public school 
teacher at Lapwai Elementary. D'Lisa holds a Master's Degree in Education from 
WSU, and is currently a UI doctoral student pursuing a Ph.D. in Curriculum and 
Instruction. She has been teaching for 13 years, 7 of them spent at Lapwai. 
Throughout her teaching career D'Lisa has been reflective on her own learning 
journey as her teaching philosophy and pedagogy focused on the importance of 
culturally responsive teaching and culturally relevant and resonant learning 
experiences for her native students. Analysis of available curriculum, materials 
of best practices, and a need for teacher preparation programs to represent 
specific Indigenous learning theories and practices inspired D'Lisa to focus on 
the development and implementation of place-based and cultural-based education. 
""Indigeneity"" became a term used in the first Indigenous theories course at UI, 
and D'Lisa saw the importance of ""sense of place"" and oral traditions as themes 
in her own teaching style. In studying the Indigenous perspectives of Shawn 
Wilson, D'Lisa saw, too, that storytelling became the research, and the 
storyteller became the researcher. Linda T. Smith's work on Decolonizing 
Methodologies helped D'Lisa to define what she was feeling, but couldn't explain 
was happening as she taught in the public school system. She then began working 
with her Indigenous cohort to outline an Indigenous Research Framework, which 
they presented to the College of Graduate Studies. Further enthusiam was created 
when the Indigenous cohort presented their framework at the 7th WSU COE 
International Globalization and Diversity and Education Conference. She is now 
working on using an Indigenous Research framework that reflects her world views, 
including the epistemology and axiology of the Nimíipuu. It is her hope that the 
way in which she pursues her research includes respect, reciprocity and 
responsibility, three key tenets to her Indigenous Research Framework.

Renée 
Holtis Dine from the Sleeping Rock or With the Rock clan and enrolled with the 
Nez Perce tribe of Idaho. Renée is a mother of three and the Graduate Assistant 
Coordinator for the Washington State University Plateau Center for American 
Indian Studies and the Clearinghouse on Native Teaching & Learning. As a third 
year PhD student in the College of Education, Cultural Studies and Social 
Thought program, she also presently serves as the Secretary for the Board of 
Directors forNational Indian Education 
Association, the 
oldest and largest Indian education organization and actively involved with the 
American Indian Studies Association.

María Isabel Moralesis a first generation Mexicana/Mestiza/Chicana college 
graduate from Eastern Washington University. She obtained her bachelor's degree 
in Interdisciplinary Studies with an emphasis in Sociology and Spanish and minor 
in Chicana/o Latina/o Studies. She is a first generation immigrant from the 
state of Michoacán and the oldest of three. She is currently a
second year doctoral student in the Cultural Studies and Social Thought in 
Education program at Washington State University. Some of María's research 
interest revolves around immigration and education, particularly access and 
equity for 'undocumented' students. 

All the work she has done and the work she has yet to do is inspired by her 
familia, and her comunidad, whom she hopes to one day serve as an activist 
scholar.

Lynn Becerra(Mexican American/Chicana/Mestiza), is a first-generation college 
graduate from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a bachelor's 
degree in Chicana and Chicano Studies. She is currently a second year doctoral 
student in the Cultural Studies and Social Thought in Education program at 
Washington State University. She is the younger sister of one and the older 
sister of two. Lynn's current research interests include working for access and 
equity for underrepresented students in P-20 education and aspires to be an 
activist-scholar. Lynn chooses to utilize a Critical Race Gender, Chicana 
Feminist and Indigenous Ways of Knowing approach to her work. She is indebted to 
the many scholars from marginalized communities who have worked on her 
behalf—both within and outside of the academy—and hope to do the same for the 
next generation.

Angel Sobotta– Is an enrolled Nimíipuu, aka Nez Perce. She resides in Lapwai, Idaho with her 
husband Bob Sobotta and their children, Payton - age 11, Glory - age 9, Grace - 
age 8 and Faith - age 4. Angel has been employed with the Nez Perce Tribe's 
Language Program for over 13 years. She has experience in theater and film. She 
wrote the scripts for the documentaries, ""'ipsqilaanx heewtnin' weetespe – 
Walking on Sacred Ground – the Nez Perce Lolo Trail"" as well as, ""Surviving 
Lewis and Clark – the Nimíipuu Story"" which won an Aurora and Telly awards

Wilson, D'Lisa saw, too, that storytelling became the research, and the 
storyteller became the researcher. Linda T. Smith's work on Decolonizing 
Methodologies helped D'Lisa to define what she was feeling, but couldn't explain 
was happening as she taught in the public school system. She then began working 
with her Indigenous cohort to outline an Indigenous Research Framework, which 
they presented to the College of Graduate Studies. Further enthusiam was created 
when the Indigenous cohort presented their framework at the 7th WSU COE 
International Globalization and Diversity and Education Conference. She is now 
working on using an Indigenous Research framework that reflects her world views, 
including the epistemology and axiology of the Nimíipuu. It is her hope that the 
way in which she pursues her research includes respect, reciprocity and 
responsibility, three key tenets to her Indigenous Research Framework. </p>

personal and informal. They broke boundaries not only because of the nature of 
his subject matter (i.e. offering what some today would call TMI), but also 
because he chose not to write in Latin (as was expected), but in the common 
French. Montaigne's definition of the essay, and the one we often use today, is 
""an attempt,"" a ""test,"" a ""trial."" The essay has its roots not in literature but 
in philosophy which is to say it is, fundamentally, an epistemological form. It 
is an instrument by which we come to know ourselves deeply and personally, and, 
therefore, the human condition.

must remove the mask,"" Montaigne wrote. All pretenses must be stripped away. 
Vulnerability must take center stage. Montaigne had the idea that there is a

some degree, about all of us. The personal essay, when artfully rendered, must 
be at once personal and universal without regard to the peculiarities of the

"trahant","Colloquium Talk, April 17, 2012, Idaho Commons","Editor-in-Residence for the School of Journalism and Mass Media and a Member of Idaho's Shoshone-Bannock Tribe.","As the country 
-- as the world -- begins dramatic changes because of demographics and climate 
change, we need to think about the stories we tell. For so much of America, the 
story has been about growth, but does that story ring true when the world of 
young people today is about less? We already live in smaller houses, we earn 
less, we drive less, indeed, in this era of contraction, a world of less will 
define our prospects.

In the business world and in government, the new narrative has been a transition 
phrase, the idea of ""more is less."" In another words you can do everything you 
did last year but with fewer resources and perhaps people. But that narrative is 
hollow at best. People cannot build a story of success based on a frenetic pace. 
We need a new way of describing a world of less in a way that makes sense to 
someone navigating that change (or, more important, for young people, looking to 
begin a career in an arch of chaos).

So what 
stories do we tell about less?How can we make less seem successful, both as a 
story and as a way of living? More or less can be the same story, perhaps retold 
from a different perspective in the wheel. A story told from the opposite spoke. 
The lecture will include examples of the same story told in a different form.","Mark Trahant is the author of ""The Last Great Battle of the Indian Wars,"" published last year. He is a member of Idaho's Shoshone-Bannock tribe and former president of the Native American Journalists Association. Trahant is the former editorial editor for The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and in 2009 won a Kaiser Foundation media fellowship to examine the Indian Health Service and its relevance to the national health reform debate

human condition. Taking on many forms--oral tradition, ritual, the written 
word, visual and artistic expression, religious experience, to name but a 
few--communication serves as a powerful force for bringing people together. 
My presentation will focus on using black and white photography to depict people 
from diverse and
various lands and 
cultures as they connect with their peers, and, as a result, often with us, 
sharing what we have in common.","Bill Voxman is a Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at the University of 
Idaho, 
having taught there for nearly forty years. His interest in black and 
white (non-digital) photography dates back many years. During this time he 
has been fortunate to couple his enjoyment of travel with his passion for that 
art form, Voxman's other interests range from fly-fishing and back-packing 
to foreign languages and music.  For more information and examples of his 
photographic art, seehis website.
