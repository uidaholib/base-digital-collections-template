### Anaconda, Saturday, 5 July [1890]

Dear Frank,

Yesterday, the "glorious fourth", I started in to do some work
and did do some although the day was not satisfactory and today
it is cloudy and raining. You can imagine in what humor I am in.
Nearly a month gone and nothing done. The oldest inhabitant
here never saw anything like it but those that are not so old say
the rainy season generally lasts until the 4th of July. This year is
certainly no exception. If it was good weather, I should have a
tough job ahead of me and as it is it makes me pretty nearly sick
and there is provocation enough without the weather.
I am in constant pain with my hip and have to limp in walking.
Sometimes it seems as if I could not stand it, but I have to.
Went up to Butte last week and tried making views in the mine
with a combination of electric and flash light and it didn't work
worth a damn, but it <em>got it</em> "all the same." Telegraphed to New
York for three more lights. When they come <em>that</em> part of the
work won't be much of a picnic.

I am getting thin and no wonder. Of all the places I ever
struck to get anything good to eat this is the worst. If you ever
see me again you may expect to behold a <em>skelating</em> [sic].
Yesterday I had a nice lunch at Mrs. Tunny's. Besides getting a
nice lunch I got the Fitz for not coming <em>oftener</em>. Only been once
before. She says, oh! if you had only come along what a splen
did time you and she would have had. They seem to be nicely
fixed and <em>will</em> as usual have some good <em>prospects</em>. She wishes to
be remembered and says she is going to write. People always are.
Letters don't come very thick from Home when you consider
there are three to write them. I don't think any of the three need
stand on ceremony about getting answers. Should like to know
how things are getting on. Sent a dispatch to San Rafael a few
days ago to have the man pay up. Did he do so? And if he <em>did</em>
not, how do you stand off the wolf?

Tell Juju Papa was very much pleased with her letter and
would like some more. Helena all the same. And when I am not
so D----- blue, will answer them.

Am going across the creek to <em>rustle</em> for grub and my stomach
kicks before [illegible]. Hope I shall have some more pleasant
news to write soon.

The wind howls so I will stop. One is enough at a time. Hope
Collis is a good boy and don't <em>wheeze</em>. Kiss them all and keep
lots for yourself.

Papa
