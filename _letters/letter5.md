### Anaconda, Sunday, 21 September [1890]

Dear Sweetheart,

Your letter came this morning and I was pleased to hear that
you, as well as Juju, were much better. Frank's letter informed
me that you had given way under the strain of continued dissipation
and I hope now that the cause is removed, that you will settle down in the even tenor of your ways and that your
"poor little belly" will get well and sound again. 

I hope you all had a nice time with the sons and daughters but
I have no doubt you are glad it is all over. I know I should be. I
am longing to get home but one thing and another puts me off
and off and the devil knows when I shall turn either end of the
old car toward the coast. When the day does come <em>nobody can</em>
be more pleased than I shall. I have no love for the country and
what is much more to the point, I have no love for anybody in it
and I want to see my "gude wife" and "my bairns" and not last
nor least my dear old sweetheart. Frank says she is going to be
awful good when I get home and she is not going to kick any
more, if you don't, so for Heaven sake try and be gentle and
don't get over the traces for my sake.

You say it looks like rain. Here there has been lots of it and
snow also and cold with all but just now it is Indian Summer and
the days are very nice <em>if</em> you did not want to make Photos, but
the air is full of haze when it is not so smokey that you can see
nothing. I hope it won't last <em>but it might</em> for two months. So
everybody says. If it does, heaven save us and send us a cook.

Tell Collis that Papa is proud to think that somebody is in the
house that can stand the racket and that is able to take care of the
rest of the folks when they get sick. Tell him to keep his eye
open and look out for the sick people and when I get home
maybe I will give him a job. Tell Frank I am glad to hear that her
health is spel-en-ded. I suppose she means by that that the <em>bad spells</em> are all over with. I am glad to hear she is not falling away,
altho you seem to think so, and I shall make no objection to
putting some of it <em>on my bones</em> if she does not try to <em>get on too much</em>. Kiss and hug them all around for me. Tell Juju that Papa
will try and write her next time and hopes this letter will find
you all well and happy. God bless you all.

Papa
