### Butte, Montana, Tuesday, 22 July [1890]

Dear Frank,

Your letters have come along at intervals and yesterday I
received Juju's last. Please give her papa's love. Tell her she is a
nice girl and to keep on in the same way. I expect to hear from
Helena and the package of views today as also from yourself.

I came up from Anaconda last week and here I have been sitting
since trying to peer though the smoke which is thick enough to cut.
There is no use to swear for I have xausted [sic] all of my vocabulary
and that is a pretty good one as you know and it only makes
more sulfur in this country where there is so much of it. It is hot and
very little wind and I can do nothing but wait. Grin. And bear it.

I sent yesterday the <em>document</em> to Uncle Andrew that makes
Somebody else administrator to an Estate that is not worth anything,
and that is off my mind. I see by Juju's letter that you
have something to eat once more and I am only sorry that it will
last so little while. Hope you will enjoy it while it does last.

Tell Myra that yesterday I had two (2) "red headed snappers"
and one I eat [sic]! and the other I don't seem to have any particular
use for. And as she likes them she can have it if she wants it.
Yesterday I went down to the city for my mail and my grub and on
the bill of fare saw something that made me laugh. And I told the
waiter that I would take some as my best girl said it was mighty
good and he laughed. And it <em>was</em> good. Tell Myra I wish she could
<em>have some</em> every day and I <em>know</em> you would like it. I hope she has
gone to work and will make some trade and reduce the expenses.

The largest mine here, the "Anaconda" which is just across
the road from my car is the one that caught fire last year and
was flooded with water to put out the fire. They have been
pumping for a long time and just before I came to Anaconda
they took out 3 of the 5 men that were killed in the mine. This
morning they are preparing to take out the other two that were
found last night. The mine is full of bad air and as it is the one
they want the most work done in I shall have to put it off until
the last. I started in when I came up to do mine work with the
flash lamps and in making preparations got hot. Caught cold in
a wet room, and yesterday I was so "Bunged up" that I could
scarcely move. Stiff today (not the vel-hand [sic]) but better.
The job is going to be interminably long, but I must wait and do
good work. I don't know when you will see me but it will surely be sometime.
I hope the San Rafael man has been in and paid
his bill. I cannot imagine what is the matter. Keep writing and
have Helena and Juju do the same. Give them all lots of hugs
and kisses and in the absence of Myras <em>Fish</em> be satisfied with
the same yourself.

Papa
