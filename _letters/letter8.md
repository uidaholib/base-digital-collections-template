### Anaconda, Monday, 15th [October 1890]

Dear Sweetheart,

I must write you a few lines however little I feel like it. You
see I am still at this horrible hole. Froze up or so nearly so.
There is no fun in it. There has been continual snow and wind
and hail and sleet and every other detestable element of weather
that the clerk can give us for nearly ten days. And with all my
other troubles my hands are <em>awful</em> and the German salve is all
used up. I bought some Russian salve a couple days ago and
used it one night and it kept me awake nearly all night with the
heat and inflammation.

I am anxious to hear from you and suppose my letters are going
to Butte. I received one from Frank that was remailed to this place.
I hope you have broken up the fever and are getting along nicely. It
is bad enough to be poor and not have anything to eat without
being sick in the bargain. I am hungry for home. I want to see you
all and hug you all and if you have nothing else, eat you all up.

I hope to get out of this place in four days and have been hoping so for a month. Some day I will make a start.

You must forgive me for not writing a longer letter. There is
nothing to say and I have got the Dumps. Kiss and hug them all
around for me and keep lots for yourself.

Papa
