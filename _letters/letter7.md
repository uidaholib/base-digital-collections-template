### Anaconda, Thursday pm, 2 October [1890]

Dear Frank,

Your letter of Sunday and Monday came today and finds me
boxed up in the car and a Snow Storm raging outside and it is cold
as it ought to be in a snowstorm. If you don't think <em>I wish</em> I was
home, you are mistaken. It is bad enough when the elements are
gracious but when they are not, "Good Gracious," it's Horrible

I hope to leave Anaconda in a few days for Butte and let us '
hope that I will not drag along then as I have here. When I last
wrote my digestive apparatus was not on a very firm basis but
was much better than<em>previously</em> and I still have my <em>backsliding</em>
days but Iam not as worried as I was about myself, but I am worried about Helena. Try and keep her at home and stuff her with the
best things you can get money to buy. Tell her I am awful sorry
but I have no fat to give her but when I get home she shall have
everything I have got, fat and lean. I send you what I can very
poorly spare and for Heaven Sake <em>don't</em> spend it for <em>anything</em> but
grub and eat and be merry and grow fat but <em>don't</em> tell us of the
good things you have and make our mouth water and then have to
eat such Stuff as one gets here if he don't cook his own potatoes. 

If this letter goes tonight it must close up. Kiss the children big
and little and give them fat hugs as you are the only one in the
family that deals in that healthy commodity. The wind is howling outside and it just goes through my rickety old bones.
But never mind we'll get fat again I hope. All of us. God bless you.

Papa
