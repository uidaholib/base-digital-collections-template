### Anaconda, Friday, 5th [September 1890]

Dear Wife and Babies and Sweet Heart,

It rains blue blazes and the wind howls and it is as cold as
Greenland or Montana and the day is generally "Dark and
Dreary" but when one gets news even under such conditions
from Wife and Babies and Sweetheart - <em>all in a heap!</em> he must
be in a bad way indeed if his heart don't feel a little chirpy and
his blood warm up if it is getting thin. I am glad that there is to
be no more <em>growling</em>.

Myra is no doubt very inconsiderate about the <em>money</em> but that
she purposely treats you mean is I think very absurd. What possible motive can she
have for doing anything of the kind and how
abundant are the reasons for her <em>not</em> doing so. Myra has her ways
as we all have and I remember you did not like them so well
before I left home. I hope you will get along without having a
rumpus and you need not worry about the amount of <em>saccharine matter</em> in any letters that I <em>may</em> write. No more growls from me.

I was especially delighted with the letter from Collis and from
Juju. I think "your boy" did splendidly for the first time and you
tell him that I shall have to take him along in the car to write my
letters for me. I hope he is well by this time and that he and Juju
and all the cousins and uncles and aunts will have a good time
during the <em>blowout</em> of the Native Sons and Daughters. I shall
expect "My Boy" and girl to write me very often as their letters
do their papa more good than Montana grub.

Tell Sweetheart that these thin legs of mine will need a heap
of magnetism if I ever get a chance again and I expect as fast as
I get it somebody will be getting it away from me. The fact is
that I am getting awful hungry for kisses and hugs and things.
Not a blessed one of any of them have I had since I left San
Francisco and I just want heaps of them.

I have got along so far without <em>loosing my head</em> and am in
hopes that I may get home again before it flies off entirely. I
don't think there will be enough left of the Haggin money to buy
beef to put me in condition again. He was here two days this
week but I did not see him.

I will write Sweetheart in a few days and I send her and the
children lots of kisses and hugs and <em>you</em> lots of things.

Papa
