### Anaconda [Montana], Wednesday, 27th [September 1890]

Dear Frank,

I am in no mood for writing but I have put it off so long that I
feel I must write a few lines. Yesterday I was taken with one of
my vertigo fits and while I manage to get about it has <em>upset</em> me
completely. I was in hopes to get through with the infernal job
before it got after me but it was not to be. I hope it will not be a
bad attack. If it should, the Lord save us. The work goes awful
slow and you may not expect to see me until the eleventh of
October and perhaps not then. I am going to try and do the best I
can. I <em>wish</em> you would do the same and try to get along without so
much growling. I don't think it makes either one of us any happier
and I am sure it don't me. I am getting very tired of Montana and I
want to see you all, Wife and Babies and Sweet Heart but I have
got to fight it out and I was not in very good fighting trim before
this last trouble. Don't worry yourself or me about bills or money.
People can't get it until I do or until I get home. With your letter
came one from Myra. No news except about a rat. Am ashamed to
say I have not written her yet. Tell Sweet Heart that when I get
full of saccharine matter I will answer her letters and in the mean
time she can keep on doing well. Is Julia so busy learning that she
can t write? And Collis too. What is the matter with him? I would
like to hear once in awhile that I have got some <em>childrens</em>.

I will try and write in a day or two and let you know how I get
along. I hope the fit will wear off. Kiss the children, Sweetheart
and yourself and lots of hugs all round.

Papa
