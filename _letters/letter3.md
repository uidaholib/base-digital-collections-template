### Butte, Sunday, 27 [July 1890]

Dear Frank,

Read your letter of 22nd yesterday and if I wanted anything to
make me cuss such a letter would be just the thing. <em>Why</em> don't
you assert your independence enough to tell people to mind their
own affairs and then mind yours.

I don't see why you should have told <em>anybody</em> about your
money business and having it. And I don't see why you should
go barefoot. And Helena, the great big slat-sided galoot setting
up a cry because some other galoot takes her to task about her
money. Its her own, ain't it? And she can do what she wants
with it. Why the H--- don't she tell them so. I am sure the
amount is not [so] large that she is likely to buy a farm with it
every month if she did go bare x-ed. The fact is I am ugly as sin
and I think your officious friends would shut up if they had me
to talk with for a little while.

I have been up here more than a week and have worked two
days in the mine. Nasty work, and I don't believe it will turn out
worth a dam. Outside the climate is <em>simply</em> execrable. Hot, dusty,
windy &#8211; a gale &#8211; and so smokey that from the Hill you can't see
the town and from the town you can't see the Hill. It is very
doubtful if I can do anything here to my satisfaction or anywhere near it.
I am getting sick literally and figuratively.

I am very sorry that your mother is unwell and I think that
you should go and take care of her. Why can't you leave Helena
in the place. She can make some arrangements about the night
trouble with some of her friends. Take what money you have left
and go. I will try and make out about the rent and I think you
would all be better for it if Helena don't kick. I am in anything
but a mood for writing today and I have to take this a long way
to mail it if it goes tonight and among my other troubles are my
feet which are in a bad way. That crooked toe is making it very
unpleasant for me and to walk is pretty near torture.

What is the matter of my Sweetheart and little girl and boy
too that they can't write. I should like to hear from them all and
often. The wind is howling. The dust is flying and it's Ott [sic].
But I will do this up and take my shanks down the Hill and I
hope that when it reaches you that all of you will all be in a better humor,
and if you are not, just imagine that I am hugging and
kissing you until you are happy. God bless you.

Papa
