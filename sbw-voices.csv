<strong>Interviewee: </strong>Art Seamans<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Lewiston, Idaho<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> April 28, 2013</p>
<p><strong>AS:</strong> I guess I was what you could call a constructionist. That type of person in that I looked at the Wilderness Act and what it said, and I tried to gear my management to what the Wilderness Act said. The Wilderness Act said that the airfields’ existence prior to use were okay, so, I wasn&#8217;t anti aircraft. We tried to work with the pilots that came in and the people that came in and camped and again make them feel welcome. Some the pilots that we talked to before I got there they didn&#8217;t feel that all welcome. They avoided coming up to the ranger station because everybody was kind of hostile to them, and we wanted to get rid of that hostility. To embrace these folks once they decided to come. But we tried to not be heavy-handed on regulation. I remember one hunting camp we had. I was coming down the Selway River by myself. I had a horse and mule. I came to a hunting camp that had just been left. The hunters had gone out, and they apparently had just gone out that morning because they had a big fire and the fire was still hot. It was full of garbage and they had tied their horses to trees and the trees were all torn up, and I found toilet paper everywhere around their camp, and I bundled up all their trash, and I called the Wilderness Ranger at the trailhead, and told them that these people would be coming out shortly, and they did, and they gave them a citation and I wanted to cite whoever the party leader was. I wanted to cite him for abandoning the fire, and leaving the trash out there. He was mad. He was angry. We didn&#8217;t do anything wrong! But I brought out… I had my saddle horse packed full of trash, and I had my mule packed with a full load of trash, and so I had two animals loaded with trash out of that one camp. When I got to town, I called them, and I called the party leader. I said I got a deal for you. I said if you guys will give us an hour of your time, we&#8217;ll meet with you wherever you want to meet, and I said I&#8217;ll tear up that citation, but I need an hour of your time. So, they agreed to meet with us, they met out here at Jock&#8217;s Spur at a restaurant in the back room of a restaurant, and we had a little dog and pony show that we put on for them. We had some slides, and showed them some of the problems we&#8217;ve had with hunting camps and some horses, and they sat there, and they expected us to sit there and chew on them and tell them how terrible they were, and we just said… tried to educate them about our objectives in managing the Selway Bitterroot and what a special place it was, and how we wanted to keep it that way, and I said okay, thank you very much for your time, and I gave him back the citation and I said, but wait I got something for you out in my pickup. So I gave him all the stuff that I&#8217;d packed out from there. The next year those guys came in, they came in to Moose Creek, they came up to the station, they said okay we’re camped down here and we love for you guys to come down and have supper with us sometime, and see what we&#8217;ve got set up for a camp and after that they were good friends and they did as good a job as anybody out there in handling their stock and a clean camp. So, rather than running them away, and these are people who had been coming in there for years and doing damage for years, we were able to get our message across and they became part of the solution rather than part of the problem.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Wow, what a great story. I love that.</p>
<p><strong>AS:</strong> Those are the kind of things that we were trying to do, and that&#8217;s when I was involved in, and every one of the Wilderness rangers did things like that. The rangers that were there before me and after me continued to try to make Moose Creek a leader in wilderness management in the country.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So can you think of some more areas in which Moose Creek was a leader besides fire?</p>
<p><strong>AS:</strong> Well in our dealings with the public we&#8230;&#8230;in the wilderness system I think a lot of folks looked at the public as the biggest danger to the wilderness system because we are trying to keep it as pristine as we can and so all those natural forces to prevail provided particular kind of recreation experience. But we went into a program where we were trying to befriend&#8230;.we weren&#8217;t trying to bring use into the wilderness but once people made a decision that they were going to visit the wilderness we wanted them to have all the tools they needed to do it with as minimal an impact as possible so we had an education program going then, we had wilderness rangers that were in the field. We had the district broken into 3 different units with a wilderness ranger in each and his job or her job was to contact the people that were visiting that area while they were in the field so we had some accountability. But our primary emphasis was at the portals, befriending people at the portals&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> And what would those portals be in your mind?</p>
<p><strong>AS:</strong> Well the portals were Elk Summit up at Lost Horse, Moose Creek and Selway Falls. Those were the primary portals where we had staff and of course we had people on the West Fork District up at Paradise and again we were trying to provide people with information, we were trying to be friendly&#8230;&#8230;we were at the same time trying to teach some different methods of using the wilderness that were low impact. We came up with a booklet that we handed out that had all kinds of interesting information trivia about experiencing Moose Creek, stories of Moose Creek, but within all those was the educational message on no-trace camping. One of the things we did, in the fall of the year for example, we had a lot of hunters. Hunters were the primary users in the fall, backpackers in the summer and to some extent floaters on the river. Although there are use levels because we were managing that river for a very low density of use. A maximum of opportunity and a minimum of regulation is what we were after. So primitive and unconfined and nothing is more confining than regulations. So we tried to keep the regulations to a minimum but the use levels were low enough that people could travel at their own pace. They didn&#8217;t have to stay at a particular camp ground. If they wanted to do the trip in 3 days they could, if they wanted to do it in 10 days they could. Cause it was again, primitive and unconfined. But we wanted them again to know how to make that trip with a minimum impact. A lot of our impact was coming from livestock in the fall during hunting season so our wilderness rangers were out there with their backpacks, backpacking around the district and talking to these hunters that were there with horses and mules and the hunters would nod and say &#8220;uh-huh. ok.&#8221; and then continue to do exactly what they were doing because the wilderness rangers didn&#8217;t have any credibilty with them. So we thought, we really had a neat group of people, the wilderness rangers, the whole crew, the trail crews, and then we had Emil and Penny Keck and Barry Hicks and Larry Cown as fire control people and Jim Bradley was my resource assistant in recreation and Jim was a very forward thinking person, a very creative person. We would get our heads together and say &#8220;Ok, we have a problem. How can we solve it? and we don&#8217;t want to confine ourselves to policy and the way we&#8217;ve done it in the past we want it to look forward. How can we solve these problems in a creative but effective way?&#8221; The main thing was to be effective. So I decided we were going to put all of our wilderness rangers on horseback in the fall. So we gave them each a horse and a mule and they were dead against it. They didn&#8217;t want anything to do with it because that horse and mule was more impact and they didn&#8217;t want to make any more impact. I told &#8217;em to shut up. We had a school where we taught them basics of horsemanship and packing and then we turned them loose out in the field. Well when they&#8217;d go into a hunting camp then, they&#8217;d come in with their horse and their mule. They immediately took to those animals and you couldn&#8217;t pry the animals away from them by the end of the first season. They loved their horse and mule. They were challenged with the whole thing about packing. About how to deal with ropes, how to tie them to a hitch, how to do this or that dealing with packing so if they went into a camp and maybe one of the people there had a horse that was really outfitted well or a pack saddle that was really outfitted, maybe a fancy finish on a rope they&#8217;d say &#8220;How do you do that?&#8221; Well then ya know the hunter would just sit down and show them how he did it and pretty soon they were actually talking and they were communicating. We began to have a lot more impact as far as being able to minimize the impact of the hunters in the fall. We were also in the critical part of getting our outfitters into light-weight gear. We had some camps that were really elaborate camps where the equipment stayed year after year and they were really big, basically permanent camps. Al Defler actually started a process of getting them converted to light-weight gear. We did a lot of work with the Missoula Equipment Development Center on developing light-weight gear that these folks could use that would serve their need but was easy to pack in and easy to pack out so in the fall they&#8217;d take everything with them.</p>",

From showcasing a museum dedicated to Lewis and Clark, to cultivating interest in the Native tradition of educational storytelling, Vern brings the past of this important area to life.

Vernon Carroll, a member of the Blackfeet Tribe, was born in Cut Bank, Montana, and worked as a cattle rancher there alongside his father, maintaining a lifelong interest in the history and culture of the native peoples who lived in Montana. His ranch itself boasted three buffalo jumps and numerous tipi rings, among other native sites and artifacts. His love of history led him to work for a year as the interim manager of the Glacier County Museum in Cut Bank. In 2002, he retired from ranching when he was hired as the pioneer Interpretative Specialist at the Traveler’s Rest State Park in Lolo, Montana.",Community; Lewis and Clark; Nimipoo Tribe; Vernon Carroll,https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/selway-podcast-ep43.mp3?_=2,"Vernon Carroll in Traveler’s Rest Museum, standing next to a quote from the Lewis and Clark journals.

<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Vernon Carroll<br />
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Location: </strong>Traveler&#8217;s Rest, Lolo, Montana<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> October 29, 2012</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong> So that’s also what sets us apart in a sense as far as the Lewis and Clark story. But again that’s just, you know, such really such a small part of the history here but it’s what, you know, it’s what has got, it’s what’s given us the opportunity to talk about those other stories.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah. So how do you, what are some of the, I mean there’s one sort of revisionary history, wait, I mean there’s like the, you know, the master narrative where they came out and conquered the land and explored and discovered and then there’s the revisionary history where Lewis and Clark brought the wave of White settlers that then, you know, put Native Peoples on reservations and killed them and chased them to Canada and stuff, that massacred. So are there some other nuance ways of looking at that meeting of these different kinds of people, people from the East or of European ancestry with people who have been camping and living and working and harvesting here, you know, forever?</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong> Uh-huh. I think the one thing that probably strikes me the most about the particular part of the story that is represented, at least in part here in the Bitterroot Valley, is the need or the reliance that the Corps had on the Native People. The fact that they were treated well. The fact that they were in many ways welcomed, not understood, and I’m absolutely certain that particularly in the encounter here with the Salish up the river here a bit that there was a lot of skepticism and it would have been just about as easy to say, you know, this is a problem, you know, and we don’t need to deal with this or.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> You mean on the part of the Salish or?</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Okay, yah.</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong> Yah, yah. In a sense I think that’s, and there are stories within the Salish tradition that it was a, they had the opportunity or they did consider at least not helping and possibly even, you know, eliminating. So there were decisions made. I think that was particularly important. I do think that also that, this is kind of getting back to the master narrative and I don’t think we want to get away too much farther from that part in a sense that realizing that there was a, you know, they were carrying the banner of manifest destiny. It was, it was, this country was destined to be coast to coast and realizing that the moment they crossed the Bitterroot or they crossed the Continental Divide they were in a foreign territory. This land was claimed primarily by the British and yet, you know, they were, you know, the term, they proceeded on. They continued and knowing full well or believing full well that this country was destined to control and they really began a process. I think that one thing that’s really, really interesting about the Lewis, is they attempted to, you know, designate or, they tried to figure out who the people were and then categorize them, not fully understand how complex, you know, the Native social structures were and, you know, wanting very much in a very kind of linear European way is to put people in boxes. And only follow that that basically from their experience in the East it was going to be a lot easier when the time came to create reservations or move people. We wanted to know that and, you know, they were essentially the first ones to kind of begin that process which continued and continued and continued, you know, right through the establishment of reservations and, you know, their failure to really understand the complexity of. And I think that, as far as implications that’s one of the most significant ones. And, yah, it was the beginning of opening up the West and, you know, the missionaries followed soon after the trappers and traders, the agriculture, the railroad, those things happened soon but, you know, Lewis and Clark in many ways kind of established that template for how this country was going to really deal with Native People and, you know, it has struck me that how little they understood and the assumptions they made and the assumptions themselves became part of the National narrative and National policy. So it was a really, really significant part of that too.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uh-huh. So what were some of the assumptions that kind of are important to you?</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong> Well, I think going back to this idea of trying to categorize people and establish some kind of order and when you don’t really have the skills or you know the understanding of the people to do that I think inevitably you’re going to mess it up and I think, you know, throughout the whole Expedition Lewis and/or Clark or whoever else made references to specific tribal groups and in many ways that sort of became the, you know, how we continue to associate. We label the people in some ways kind of based on what, you know, they, and I don’t know the story particularly well but even the understanding of who the people were here and, you know, Flathead was a term that kind of came out of that and we all wonder where that comes from. They had very creative use of some Native, of Salish language to describe the area which Salish people now kind of scratch their head and say that’s not even a word, we don’t even know what that means but yet it became, you know, it became part of through their journals and through their maps, you know, how when we start writing things down they tend to become, yah.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So their journals and words and maps went back East and, you know, over the Atlantic and then people read those and when they came out they had those because I’ve read Thompson’s journals and he actually not too long after Lewis and Clark is referring to Lewis and Clark saying oh, now I see what they were.</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong> Yah, exactly.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> What they saw but if they wouldn&#8217;t have had that they might have seen something very different.</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong> They would have seen something different or interpreted it differently.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong> So I think, you know, that that’s I think one of the things that’s probably to me one of the most interesting and yet kind of one of the most troubling things about that was, you know, was that particular part and how they interpreted what they saw. And then we can just sort of add on the consequences of that. You know, from that point forward that was kind of the beginning. So, yah, that was, that’s one thing that was always, is interesting to me and I’ve been doing a little research on some of the folks over along the Columbia River and how they essentially did the same thing and how that became again sort of the road map for Government policy at that point. Assumptions that Lewis and Clark made people just kind of carried forward. And, you know.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Like what, they were friendly or they are warrior?</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong> Or a part of it was even just assuming because of where people were located, assuming that, assuming a much greater relationship between those peoples because of, you know, when you encounter a couple of groups in a certain area your assumption might be maybe this is sort of, you know, based on their experience in the eastern part of this country was that these people must be related. Linguistically there may be some similarities but you’re not recognizing that things were probably a lot more complicated.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong> There’s a, you know, even issues, legal issues with regards to treaty rights that tend to pop up all the time in how people were kind of arbitrarily thrown together. The Flathead Reservation here in Montana is a great example. We have the Salish, the Kootenai, and the Pend Oreille. People who lived in the same area but through the wisdom of Isaac Stevens he kind of tossed them all together without really considering how that was going to work and it was particularly devastating to the Salish people because they were asked to leave the Bitterroot Valley and to move to an area that they had had some association with and live with people they’d had some association with but it wasn’t home and so I think we, you know, kind of see those kinds of things that, you know. I can see, you can almost see the seeds of that in the Lewis and Clark Expedition how that all came to pass.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uh-huh. Do you know much about how the different, the Salish and the Nez Perce or the Nimipoo used the Bitterroots themselves, the mountains?</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong> Uh-huh. Well, I think to me and I don’t know probably enough about it to speak with much authority but at least my experience and my understanding was that as far as sort of a traditional homeland and, you know, I realize that tribes are very mobile but the Bitterroot, at least this part of the Bitterroot Valley, probably represented more of the homeland to the Salish people. It was an area that was utilized to travel through by the Nez Perce and other tribes too. So I think within the context of the Bitterroot Valley, at least this portion of the valley. I think the relationship, the home relationship was probably, you know, that was how the Salish thought of it. Of course, it was an area where, you know, again we have all this travel and trade and it’s, I think it’s really, really hard to separate, well, I guess, it’s hard to, you know, I guess this kind of goes back to a tendency we like to do when we study things is we like to sort of compartmentalize activities like these are social activities and these are hunting activities and these are ceremonial activities. And I think within the Native culture those weren’t separated. So, again the how, well again I think there was a significance, a lot of social mixing here. I think the Salish and the Nez Perce in particular had a lot of kinship ties that were a part of this particular place. I think the traveling through, there’s significant evidence that the Salish and the Nez Perce traveled together to hunt the bison and that again represented, it wasn’t this neat little hunting thing, it was much more than that. So I think that, but my understanding and I may not be right about this is that the valley itself kind of represented as the traditional homeland of the Salish but yet again it was utilized and appreciated by the Nez Perce and some other tribes too.</p>","<p><a href=""http://www.travelersrest.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Photo Credit</a><br />

sbw321,Nineteen-nineteen,"August 9, 2013",2013-08-09,Episode 42,sbw321.mp3,22:07,"In this episode, titled “Nineteen-nineteen” we hear an excerpt from “USFS1919: A Ranger, A Cook and a Hole in the Sky”, which makes up part of Norman MacLean’s best-known work: <em>A River Runs Through It</em>.

Born in Clarinda, Iowa, on December 23, 1902, Norman was the son of Clara and the Reverend John Norman Maclean, a Presbyterian minister, who managed much of the education of Norman and his brother Paul. In 1909, the family relocated to Missoula, Montana, where the landscape made a considerable impression on the young Norman. Because he was too young to enlist in the military during World War I, Norman worked in logging camps and for the United States Forest Service in what is now the Bitterroot National Forest of northwestern Montana. The novella USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky is a semi-fictionalized accounts of these experiences.

In 1931, Norman married Jessie Burns, and in 1940, he earned his doctorate from the University of Chicago where he declined a commission in Naval intelligence to serve as Dean of Students during World War II. At the University of Chicago, Maclean taught Shakespeare and the Romantic poets, and during his last decade on the Chicago faculty, Maclean held an endowed chair as William Rainey Harper Professor of English.

After his retirement in 1973, he began to write down the stories he liked to tell to his children, John and Jean. <em>A River Runs Through It and Other Stories</em> was published in 1976, the first work of original fiction published by the University of Chicago Press and was nominated by a selection committee to receive the Pulitzer Prize in Letters in 1977, but the full committee ignored the nomination and did not award a Pulitzer in that category for the year.

Norman Maclean died on August 2, 1990, in Chicago, at the age of 87 of natural causes.

<p>I was young and I thought I was tough and I knew it was beautiful and I was a little bit crazy but hadn&#8217;t noticed it yet. Outside the ranger station there were more mountains in all directions than I was ever to see again—oceans of mountains—and inside the station at this particular moment I was ahead in a game of cribbage with the ranger of the Elk Summit District of the Selway Forest of the United States Forest Service (USFS), which was even younger than I was and enjoyed many of the same characteristics.</p>
<p>It was mid-August of 1919, so I was seventeen and the Forest Service was only fourteen, since, of several possible birthdays for the Forest Service, I pick 1905, when the Forest Division of the Department of the Interior was transferred to the Department of Agriculture and named the United States Forest Service.</p>
<p>In 1919 it was twenty-eight miles from the Elk Summit Ranger Station of the Selway Forest to the nearest road, fourteen miles to the top of the Bitterroot Divide and fourteen straight down Blodgett Canyon to the Bitterroot Valley only a few miles from Hamilton, Montana. The fourteen miles going down were as cruel as the fourteen going up, and far more dangerous, since Blodgett Canyon was medically famous for the tick that gave Rocky Mountain Fever, with one chance out of five for recovery. The twenty-eight-mile trail from Elk Summit to the mouth of Blodgett Canyon was a Forest Service trail and therefore marked by a blaze with a notch on top; only a few other trails in the vast Elk Summit district were so marked. Otherwise, there were only game trails and old trappers’ trails that gave out on open ridges and meadows with no signs of where the game or trappers had vanished. It was a world of strings of pack horses or men who walked alone—a world of hoof and foot and the rest done by hand. Nineteen nineteen across the Bitterroot Divide in northern Idaho was just before the end of most of history that had had no fourwheel drives, no bulldozers, no power saws and nothing pneumatic to take the place of jackhammers and nothing chemical or airborne to put out forest fires.</p>
<p>Nowadays you can scarcely be a lookout without a uniform and a college degree, but in 1919 not a man in our outfit, least of all the ranger himself, had been to college. They still picked rangers for the Forest Service by picking the toughest guy in town. Ours, Bill Bell, was the toughest in the Bitterroot Valley, and we thought he was the best ranger in the Forest Service. We were strengthened in this belief by the rumor that Bill had killed a sheepherder. We were a little disappointed that he had been acquitted of the charges, but nobody held it against him, for we all knew that being acquitted of killing a sheepherder in Montana isn&#8217;t the same as being innocent.</p>
<p>As for a uniform, our ranger always wore his .45 and most of our regular crew also packed revolvers, including me. Bill was built to fit his hands. He was big all over. Primarily he was a horseman, and he needed an extra large horse. He was not the slender cowboy of the movies and the plains. He was a horseman of the mountains. He could swing an ax or pull a saw, run a transit and build trail, walk all day if he had to, put on climbing spurs and string number nine telephone wire, and he wasn&#8217;t a bad cook. In the mountains you work to live, and in the mountains you don&#8217;t care much whether your horse can run fast. Where&#8217;s he going to run? Bill&#8217;s horse was big and long-striding, and could walk all day over mountain trails at five miles an hour. He was a mountain horse carrying a mountain man. Bill called him Big Moose. He was brown and walked with his head thrown back as if he wore horns.</p>
<p>Every profession has a pinnacle to its art. In the hospital it is the brain or heart surgeon, and in the sawmill it is the sawyer who with squinting eyes makes the first major cut that turns a log into boards. In the early Forest Service, our major artist was the packer, as it usually has been in worlds where there are no roads. Packing is an art as old as the first time man moved and had an animal to help him carry his belongings. As such, it came ultimately from Asia and from there across Northern Africa and Spain and then up from Mexico and to us probably from Indian squaws. With the coming of roads, this ancient art has become almost a lost art, but in the early part of this century there were still few roads across the mountains and none across the “Bitterroot Wall.” From the mouth of Blodgett Canyon, near Hamilton, Montana, to our ranger station at Elk Summit in Idaho nothing moved except on foot. When there was a big fire crew to be supplied, there could be as many as half a hundred mules and short-backed horses heaving and grunting up the narrow switchbacks and dropping extra large amounts of manure at the sharp turns. The ropes tying the animals together would jerk taut and stretch their connected necks into a straight line until they looked like dark gigantic swans circling and finally disappearing into a higher medium.</p>
<p>Bill was our head packer, and the Forest Service never had a better one. As head packer, [he] rode in front of the string, a study in angles. With black Stetson hat at a slant, he rode with his head turned almost backward from his body so he could watch to see if any of the packs were working loose. Later in life I was to see Egyptian bas-reliefs where the heads of men are looking one way and their bodies are going another, and so it is with good packers. After all, packing is the art of balancing packs and then seeing that they ride evenly—otherwise the animals will have saddle sores in a day or two and be out of business for all or most of the summer.</p>
<p>Up there in front with Bill, you could see just about anything happen. A horse might slip or get kicked out of the string and roll frightened downhill until he got tangled around a tree trunk. You might even have to shoot him, collect the saddle, and forget the rest of what was scattered over the landscape. But mostly what you were watching for took Bill&#8217;s trained eye to see—a saddle that had slipped back so far the animal couldn&#8217;t breathe, or a saddle that had slipped sideways. In an outfit that large, there are always a few “shad bellies” that no cinch can hang on to and quite a few “bloaters” that blow up in the morning when the cinch touches them and then slowly deflate.</p>
<p>The Bitterroot Divide, with its many switchbacks, granite boulders, and bog holes, brought out every weakness in a packer, his equipment, and his animals. To take a pack string of nearly half a hundred across the Bitterroot Divide was to perform a masterpiece in that now almost lost art, and in 1919 I rode with Bill Bell and saw it done.</p>
<p>The divide was just as beautiful as the way up. In August it was blue with June lupine. Froth dropped off the jaws of the horses and mules, and, snorting through enlarged red nostrils, the animals shook their saddles, trying without hands to rearrange their loads. Not far to the south was El Capitan, always in snow and always living up to its name. Ahead and to the west was our ranger station—and the mountains of Idaho, poems of geology stretching beyond any boundaries and seemingly even beyond the world.</p>
<p>Six miles or so west of the divide is a lake, roughly two-thirds of the way between Hamilton and Elk Summit, that is the only place where there is water and enough grass to hold a big bunch of horses overnight. K. D. Swan, the fine photographer of the early Forest Service, should have been there to record the design of the divide—ascending in triangles to the sky and descending in ovals and circles to an oval meadow and an oval lake with a moose knee-deep beside lily pads. It was triangles going up and ovals coming down, and on the divide it was springtime in August.</p>
<p>The unpacking was just as beautiful—one wet satin back after another without saddle or saddle sore, and not a spot of white wet flesh where hair and hide had rubbed off. Perhaps one has to know something about keeping packs balanced on the backs of animals to think this beautiful, or to notice it at all, but to all those who work come moments of beauty unseen by the rest of the world.</p>
<p>[Once, while] working with the packs [Bill] said, “Why don&#8217;t you go up on the lookout for a couple of weeks and find out [if there are rattlers up there]?”</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t ask him when; I knew he meant now. I lifted the two packs until I thought they were balanced, and then started for the door. He added, “If you spot any fires, call them in. And, if there&#8217;s a big rain or snow, close up camp and come back to the station.”</p>
<p>I knew it would be dark before I got to Grave Peak, so I asked the cook to make me a sandwich. I had a big blue bandanna handkerchief, and I put the sandwich in the handkerchief and tied the handkerchief to my belt in the middle of my back. I picked up my razor, toothbrush, and comb, and my favorite ax and Carborundum stone. Then I strapped on my .32-20 and started up the high trail.</p>
<p>It was twelve miles and all up, but I never stopped to rest or eat the sandwich. Bill seemed to be watching all the time. By walking hard I kept even with daylight until near the end. Then darkness passed over me from below—just the dazzling peak above told me where I was going.</p>
<p>Modern lookouts live on top of their peaks in what are called “birdcages&#8221;—glass houses on towers with lightning rods twisted around them so that the lookouts are not afraid of lightning striking them, and for twenty-four hours a day can remain on the towers to watch for lightning to strike and smoke to appear. This, of course, is the way it should be, but in 1919 birdcages, as far as we knew, were only for birds. We watched from the open peak and lived in a tent in a basin close to the peak where usually there was a spring of water. From my camp to the lookout was a good half-hour climb, and I spent about twelve hours a day watching mountains.</p>
<p>Near the top there were few trees and nearly all of them had been struck by lightning. It had gone around them, like a snake of fire. But I was to discover that, on a high mountain, lightning does not seem to strike from the sky. On a high mountain, lightning seems to start somewhat below you and very close by, seemingly striking upward and outward. Once it was to knock me down, toss branches over me and leave me sick.</p>
<p>The basin where my tent was pitched was covered with chunks of cliff that had toppled from above. I did not see a rattlesnake, but I shared the basin with a grizzly bear who occasionally came along flipping over fallen pieces of disintegrated cliff as he looked for disproportionately small grubs. When I saw him coming, I climbed the highest rock and tried to figure out how many hundreds of grubs he had to eat for a square meal. When he saw me, he made noises in his mouth as if he were shifting his false teeth. In a thicket on top of a jack pine, I found the skeleton of a deer. Your guess is as good as mine. Mine is that the snow in the high basin was deep enough to cover the trees, and the deer was crossing the crust and broke through or was killed and eventually the snow melted. There was a tear in my tent so when it rained I could keep either my food or my bed dry, but not both.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take much in the way of body and mind to be a lookout. It&#8217;s mostly soul. It is surprising how much our souls are alike, at least in the presence of mountains. For all of us, mountains turn into images after a short time and the images turn true. Gold-tossed waves change into the purple backs of monsters, and so forth. Always something out of the moving deep, and nearly always oceanic. Never a lake, never the sky. But no matter what images I began with, when I watched long enough the mountains turned into dreams, and still do, and it works the other way around—often, waking from dreams, I know I have been in the mountains, and I know they have been moving—sometimes advancing threateningly, sometimes creeping hesitantly, sometimes receding endlessly. Both mountains and dreams.</p>
<p>While I was making breakfast [on my last day on the Graves Peak Lookout], I heard the ticktock of a clock repeating, “It&#8217;s time to quit; it&#8217;s time to quit.” I heard it almost as soon as it began, and almost that soon I agreed. I said to myself, “You fought a big fire and packed a big gun,” and I said, “You slit waxy sticks of dynamite and stuck detonation caps in them and jumped back to watch them sizzle,” and then I said, “You helped Bill pack and you watched mountains by yourself. That&#8217;s a summer&#8217;s work. Get your time and quit.” I said these things several times to impress them on myself. I knew, in addition, that the fire season was over; in fact, the last thing the ranger had told me was to come in if it snowed [and it had]. So I rang two longs for the ranger station; I rang two longs until I almost pulled the crank off the telephone, but in my heart I knew that the storm had probably blown twenty trees across the line between the peak and the station. Finally, I told myself to stay there until tomorrow when most of the snow would be gone and then to walk to the station and get my time and start over the hill to Hamilton.</p>
<p>What I neglected to tell myself is that it is almost impossible to quit a ranger who is sore because you do not like his cook, or to quit a story once you have become a character in it.</p>
<p>[When I got down,] Bill said, “Why do you go back with the trail crew? They&#8217;ve been doing without you, and I need somebody around camp to help me straighten out the stuff now that the season is over.” Then he said, as if he had put the two things together in his mind, “How about a game of cribbage at the station tonight?” I said I would if he needed me and to myself I said I&#8217;d put off for a day or two telling him that I was going to quit. More and more, I sensed I was slipping out of life and being drawn into a story. I couldn&#8217;t quit even when it was time to quit.</p>
<p>Ever since the ranger had realized that the cook was fancy with the cards and so had taken my place as his favorite, I&#8217;d felt a growing need to set a record. I wished that it could be in packing and that I could become known overnight as one of the Decker brothers, who had designed the latest packsaddle, but I couldn&#8217;t live long in that pipe dream, and powder work made me sick, so it had to be walking. I knew I could outwalk anyone in our district, and at the moment I needed a little local fame, and I needed it bad.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight miles from Elk Summit to the mouth of Blodgett Canyon plus a few more miles to Hamilton is not outstanding distance, just as distance, but still it is a damn tough walk. For one thing, those were Forest Service miles, and, in case you aren&#8217;t familiar with a “Forest Service mile,” I&#8217;ll give you a modern well-marked example. Our family cabin is near the Mission Glaciers and naturally one of the many nearby lakes is named Glacier Lake, which is at the end of the Kraft Creek Road, except that the final pitch is so steep you have to make it on foot. Where the trail starts there is a Forest Service sign reading: “Glacier Lake—1 Mi.” Then you climb quite a way on the trail toward Glacier Lake and you come to another Forest Service sign reading: “Glacier Lake—1.2 Mi.” So a good working definition of a “Forest Service mile” is quite a way plus a mile and two-tenths, and I was going to walk over thirty Forest Service miles to Hamilton, about half of them up until I was above mountain goats and the other half down and down until my legs would beg to start climbing again and I wouldn&#8217;t be able to comply. The trail was full of granite boulders, and I would manage somehow so that Bill would hear that I had walked it in a day.</p>
<p>Long before daylight I was using my feet like beetle feelers to find my way across Horse Heaven Meadow. Don&#8217;t look at me, look at the map, because I don&#8217;t have the kind of a mind that could make up a name like that. Even if you want to drop the Horse Heaven business, you still have a high mountain meadow just before daybreak, full of snorts and spooks. There are lots of horses out there but also a lot of other big animals. Elk and deer for sure. Maybe bear. They wake in darkness and come down from the hills to drink, and then slowly feed toward higher ground until it gets hot and is time for them to lie down again. A clank in the darkness is the scariest of all sounds, but you know a second afterwards it has to be a hobbled horse. If you are listening for dainty sounds to signify deer, there is nothing daintier than a snort—but there are deer there. They snort, and then bound. Elk snort, and then crash. Bear bolt straight uphill in a landslide—no animal has such pistons for hindquarters.</p>
<p>I still walked in wonderland after daylight. Far ahead on gray cliffs I could see the white specks that were not spots in my eyes. The trail was already getting steep and I knew before noon I would be higher than the mountain goats and from experience I knew that there is nothing much higher on earth.</p>
<p>When I finally made the divide, I carefully studied the center of it, traced in my mind what I designated as the state line between Idaho and Montana and then made a small section of it real by pissing on it—a very short dehydrated state line. I always did this on big divides, especially on the Continental Divide where one is left wondering whether he is going to drain into the Atlantic or the Pacific. The divide here is not the Continental Divide, but it stirs the imagination.</p>
<p>Then I sat down and rested above the white goats. I looked back where I had worked three summers, and it looked strange. When you look back at where you have been, it often seems as if you have never been there or even as if there were no such place. Of the peaks in the sky, my old lookout, Grave Peak, of course, was the one I knew best. When I lived on it, it was a hard climb out of a basin full of big rocks and small grubs, a tent with a finally-mended hole, trees decapitated by lightning, no soft place to sit and one grizzly and one rattlesnake. But here from the divide, it was another reality. It was sculpture in the sky, devoid of any detail of life. There is a peak near my home town we call Squaw&#8217;s Teat. It is not a great mountain but it has the right name for Grave Peak when viewed from the distance of the divide. From the divide the mountain I had lived on was bronze sculpture. It was all shape with nothing on it, just nothing. It was just color and shape and sky. It was as if some Indian beauty before falling asleep forever had decided to leave exposed what she thought was not quite her most beautiful part. So perhaps at a certain perspective what we leave behind is often wonderland, always different from what it was and generally more beautiful.</p>","<p>Excerpt From: MacLean, Norman. “A River Runs Through It and Other Stories, Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition.” University of Chicago Press. <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/river-runs-through-it-other/id566636521?mt=11"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">iBooks</a>.<br />

Located deep in the heart of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, Moose Creek has housed Forest Service employees, work crews, volunteers, outfitters, visitors, and celebrities. Because it can only be accessed by airplane or thirty miles of non-vehicle trail, Moose Creek Ranger Station tends to foster tight communities within the people who live and work there each season. From the early days of the Forest Service in the 1920’s and 30’s, to the passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964, to the present day when the Selway-Bitterroot Foundation organizes volunteer crews to maintain the trails and manage fires, Moose Creek has been one of the central heartbeats of the Selway-Bitterroot area.

<p><em>First of all, Penny Keck, who lived at Moose Creek for 29 years, tells about some of the interesting events and visitors.</em></p>
<p><strong>Debbie Lee (interviewer):</strong> So you were there at Dick and Sarah’s wedding or not? On the field, the Moose Creek field?</p>
<p><strong>Penny Keck:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Holman (interviewer):</strong> Yah, you guys were there.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah, so what was that like to have a wedding? Was that the first wedding back there or?</p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> To my awareness, yes.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah, so what was that like to be back there? What do you remember from that event?</p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> I just was in interesting awe of the participants more than anything else, that they chose that and I never had an opportunity to talk with Dick much why. Because actually he and I got closer after that time than preceding that time. But, no, it was an excellent wedding that I think everybody enjoyed.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah.</p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> Yah, it’s interesting to see what. There’s so many things that transpired. I mean, weddings, bigwigs back there, you name it and it has occurred.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah. Who were the bigwigs that you ran into?</p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> Oh, there’s quite a few from the regional offices and, of course, one of the senators from Virginia came out there. And there were some state representatives and senators out there as well. Don’t misunderstand me, it wasn’t just. And this phenomenal senator from Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> What was his name, do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> Warner.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> John Warner?</p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> I had no idea.</p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> And why were they back there? Were they vacationing or were they on inspection?</p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> I think it was a show-me trip. I believe the supervisors and regional foresters thought it helped the Forest Service’s cause to allow someone back there to understand it a little more. And, me, I was sort of in the background obviously instead of the foreground because I said let them handle it kiddos. I mean, here was, who was the ranger at the time?</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> Groats and Geffler, Hicks.</p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> Art Seamans?</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> Art Seamans, could be.</p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> It was either Art or Geffler. And, of course, Emil was in the thick of it. And so be it.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://whistlererin.com/Selway-Podcast-ep41.mp3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Download Podcast</a></p>"

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Jane Holman<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Moscow, Idaho<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> March 5, 2013</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So do you remember any points where you were&#8230;.where there was like a conflict or some decision that had to be made that was different now that the Wilderness Act was being implemented? Like for chainsaws or roads or vehicles back there or… I mean just some points where a decision was made after the wilderness act that would have been a different decision before it. Were you there for any of those?</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> Oh sure! um&#8230;I think the first fall&#8230;.probably in &#8217;68. Um there was&#8230;.hunting season was about to start&#8230;so that would be mid-September I think. And I think it was the Three Links Crossing trail in from Big Fog. It hadn&#8217;t been cut out and of course, outfitters used that trail and all that so we knew that had to be cut out. So Bill and I and Emil and Penny and a couple of head of stock, I think. We had pack stock, we weren&#8217;t riding. Headed up there to cut out the trail, and of course, Emil had a chainsaw and he was chaining away because ya know, we had to get it done ‘cause hunting season started the next day or whatever. And… anyhow, so those were kind of interesting things that um&#8230;Bill went along with at that point I think in order to have the trail open, I think. We didn&#8217;t do that anymore or I don&#8217;t think Bill did it anymore after that, that I recall anyway. Emil may well have, ‘cause he was off by himself a lot.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> I see&#8230;.but you were aware at that…</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> Oh yeah</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> In that maybe five years before you wouldn&#8217;t have&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> Oh, I would never have thought a thing about it! A silly little thing I remember from being on the Salmon River that when you would hike down a trail and cross a creek there was always an old tin can on a bush someplace ‘cause you could use it to drink and that was just what people did for each other cause that was how you managed in the backwoods. And I remember remarking on that, and of course it was very anti-wilderness that you would leave any old tin cans along the creek! It was just something I was used to, but it was just interesting how in your mind you see &#8220;oh, ok that would be wrong&#8221; but you have to think through how those changes affect you. There were lots of issues with Jeeps, the guy at Seminole Ranch had the Jeep and he would you know, fly stuff in and then we would have to go tell him to take the Jeep back down and all that&#8230;and I can&#8217;t remember if there was ever legal action, or how that all played out but I do remember that being an issue and of course then you had to worry about the outfitters and were they using chainsaws and&#8230;oh, it was&#8230;it was a constant thing.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yeah&#8230;and now it seems to be pretty&#8230;.um… accepted back there.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> I think so. I mean I don&#8217;t know what the outfitters do these days but I&#8217;m quite sure they don&#8217;t do it obviously, if they&#8217;re using mechanized things, I think they&#8217;re pretty used to having it be&#8230;.and I&#8217;m sure there have been some cases over time where they had to ya know&#8230;.but you can understand how it took awhile for them, I mean, that&#8217;s their livelihood and it made their work a whole lot harder when that change came along. Plus, they used to be able to leave their gear all winter. They&#8217;d have a cache of all the stuff and their tents and all those kinds of things and of course, they made them stop doing that and then they um&#8230;.one of them had an old cook stove. An old big old, ya know black woodstove and Emil blew it up one time with dynamite&#8230;haha&#8230;in order to get of out of there&#8230;and that irritated the outfitter community quite a bit. So there was a lot of violent things going on too with the wilderness implement there.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So how did you feel about these changes? Were you..um&#8230;did you have any conflicts inside? Like, I see that this needs to happen in order for solitude or whatever wilderness character you were implementing for but at the same time, people had been doing this stuff for twenty years&#8230;like was it difficult for you? Like just&#8230;.intellectually?</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> No, I don&#8217;t think so&#8230;I remember thinking it was great, because I was very pleased that these huge pieces of land were being saved forever and&#8230;.now, I confess, of course, I&#8217;m living in a nice little cabin there in Moose Creek. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m living in a tent all summer and all that sort of thing. Although, I probably would have been fine with that too but&#8230;ya know, it was a comfortable life there and all that. But no, I thought it was good. I liked the idea that we&#8230;that we were making that way of life. Easing it into that way of life and the solitude would always be there and hopefully&#8230;.you know, the trails needed to be there so people could have access. But I liked the idea that it was protected in that way and, I thought it was good. So no, I felt very good about it. You felt like you were part of something wonderful that&#8217;s happening and something really important.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> I see. So, now when you go back there do you see&#8230;do you feel like you were part of making that place&#8230;of re-wilding it or whatever?</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> I do. I kind of do. I mean, I certainly feel like a part of that place when I go back. I mean, it looks very much like it did when I was there. There&#8217;s a few small changes, you know, and one of the big one&#8217;s is&#8230;and one of the changes that occurred, although, not so much while we were there was, that they started letting fires burn in the wilderness and that wasn&#8217;t really true while we were at Moose Creek specifically. It was more after we moved to Missoula that that started to happen with Bob Mutch and all those guys. Now, when I floated the river a couple of years ago and when I was back last summer, you notice the landscape has changed because it used the be that the northern, the north facing slope along the river was all green and dark timber and all that and now a lot of it is snags and all that from the burns&#8230;.and that&#8217;s ok. You know, that&#8217;s part of the continuity of nature and it will once again be dark timber and it will burn again so um it&#8217;s good, I like it, I&#8217;m very fond of that.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So when you guys&#8230;I know that when my grandfather was back there that there were a lot more cabins back there and there probably were still a lot when you first got back there in 1968 so part of the process of re-wilding the landscape was either letting those cabins rot back to earth or like they did at Seminole Ranch, actually transporting them out, or burning them.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> Yes, Bill and I burned one, one spring. The old Faye Smith cabin which was down below the station. Just down on the flat just a little bit north of Seminole, and yeah I have a picture somewhere of us just standing there and I just thought &#8220;oooh.&#8221; And so&#8230;but yeah, it felt weird to burn that cabin. But, on the other hand it was in the wilderness and there shouldn&#8217;t have been a cabin. Are there other cabins? I don’t think there are any other cabins that are on the forest, that I’m aware of that aren’t… maybe you can see a sill log or something. It’s part of history. But I don’t think there’s any cabins left that aren’t on private land there, that I’m aware of, in the Selway.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> No, I don’t know of any, but I have seen cabin footings in some fields where you can…….like Hawthorns usually grow up where the cabin footings are so if you see a field with four Hawthorns you know that that’s probably where the four corners of a cabin, as in if you dig underneath there you can find the footings.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> There’s some place probably up by where Moose Creek Ranches, there used to be Daffodils in the spring that you’d see that would come up and I think eventually they go away but….</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, how do you feel about even just the remains of stuff like that? Like is that…..because how, where do you make the separation from the natural environment to the historical or the cultural and um….I mean, I don’t think there’s an answer to this it’s all just kind of speculation but since you’ve been such a part of this history I’m just wondering how you feel about it?</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> I’m actually ok with places where you can see the old sill logs and stuff and I like being able to find out uhh…like, through projects such as yours for example, who lived there and why they were there and what they did there and all that, and going: ok, that’s the remains of somebody’s dream from one point but now it’s part of the….because you can’t ever make anything completely pristine again it’s just not possible and so I think it’s ok if there’s little bits left. I mean I was pretty happy to see the Seminole Ranch gone. Cause it was, you know, awfully modern and all that sort of thing and didn’t need to be there since the forest service had purchased the land. But um, maybe it’s just cause I was there but I’m not offended by going by North Star or Selway Lodge or anything where there still are buildings and you know they may not be there someday, I don’t know but, I think it’s ok, I don’t mind seeing it. Cause part of it…it’s wonderful to be in those places to enjoy nature but I’m also fascinated by the history of why people are there and what made them come there and all that sort of thing….. and I grew up with lots of people who lived like that and it’s just interesting….so, I like it.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Um, can you just talk a little bit more about burning that cabin? Um…what it was like?</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> Well we just walked down, I’m pretty sure it was in the spring, nobody else was around I don’t think and oh, we probably took down some white gas or something and just poured it on the foundation and burned it up and it burned up in a short amount of time. I assume we went down late….must’ve gone back later and cleaned up the residue from the burning. I don’t remember actually doing that but maybe some of the staff did. I do remember that. But it seemed……I don’t think in those days I knew who Faye Smith was and obviously I had not heard the tapes of him and all that sorta thing…um, I probably would’ve, I might’ve felt a little differently or it’s not that I wouldn’t have wanted to do it but it would’ve felt more poignant I think had I known that beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yeah&#8230;So when you moved back to Idaho&#8230;what was it&#8230;seven years ago?</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> Um, it&#8217;s eight years ago this year</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Eight years ago.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> yeah in 2005.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So were there things that you noticed about&#8230;cause I know you&#8217;ve been going to the backcountry a lot, since you moved back, that you thought &#8220;oh, I forgot about this I really, now I remember how much I really loved this.” Or&#8230;do you have one of those kind of moments?</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> I think one of this… things is the smells. Oh my gosh, the smells of the Balsam Fir or you know spruce trees or something or those really wet places where it&#8217;s mossy and all that. I loved that. It&#8217;s great, I like that. And I just like being out where there are no people. I mean I can cope with people but I think it&#8217;s better to be where there are no people. So I enjoy that a lot. And I love the Palouse. I just think it&#8217;s the most beautiful sensual landscape there is anywhere. I would come home at least once or twice a year from DC and I always would fly to Spokane and rent a car and drive to Dixie and it would always be&#8230;.it was always like, ohhh&#8230;when you started out, left Spokane and started out on the Palouse, it&#8217;s the most peaceful landscape, I&#8217;ve always thought. That was always in the back of your head when you remember the wonderful places, and maybe all that stuff gets you through when there&#8217;s a lot of crowding and irritation and you&#8217;re in traffic for hours and all that. Good memories to start with.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://whistlererin.com/Selway-Podcast-ep40.mp3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Download Podcast</a></p>

sbw325,Impact,"July 18, 2013",2013-07-18,Episode 38,sbw325.mp3,13:07,"In this episode, titled “Impact,” we hear from Emil Keck, who had an enormous impact on the policies and people of wilderness in the Selway-Bitterroot area.

Emil Keck worked as a Forest Service employee beginning in 1962. He was in charge of construction and maintenance of some 400 miles of trails, a half-dozen suspension bridges, another dozen span bridges, the small collection of buildings around the district, and the four remaining fire lookout towers on the 550,000-plus acres that comprise the Moose Creek district in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness.

Emil, the oldest of nine children born to Russian immigrants, spent his first seven years in a sod hut in North Dakota. He began work as a logger and — before his future wife Penny was hired — had strongly objected to having women employees on the district. Following their marriage, Emil and Penny began living at the Moose Creek Ranger Station year-round. When Emil was forced to retire in 1979, Penny became the paid employee, and he stayed on as a volunteer. They continued to live and work at Moose Creek until 1988, when Emil was asked to leave. He died shortly afterward in 1990.

This excerpt is taken from an interview conducted by Don Biddison on November 4, 1988. Emil discusses the work he did in re-wilding the Selway-Bitterroot area in the early years of wilderness, and the work he and Penny undertook to educate campers, hunters, hikers, outfitters and rafters in care and maintenance of the beautiful natural resource by packing out garbage, not creating shortcuts that cause erosion in trails and using ideas that would eventually lead to “Leave No Trace” education in wilderness use.",Community; Emil Keck; Penny Keck,https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/selway-podcast-ep38.mp3?_=7,"Emil and Penny Keck, ca 1976.

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Don Biddison<br />
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Emil Keck<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Lolo, Idaho<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> November 4, 1988</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> Well, let’s back up and take it chronologically. You went to work at Moose Creek in ’62 if my recollection is correct.</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> No, I was down here in ’62.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> You were down here.</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> I was at Fenn.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> When did you go to work at Moose Creek?</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> Well, I went to work at Moose Creek the following year.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> In ’63.</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> Yeah. You see, Milo wasn’t there. I was up there in the office at Fenn, and the telephone rang. I remember the number 9 rang, and it was Hess on the other end, up there at Moose Creek.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> It was John Hossick?</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> Hess. His boss. Hossick was boss. Hossick was his foreman, was the ranger. Hess was an alternate ranger, a fire control officer. He said, I’m going to leave here. I said, what’s the matter with you? Well, he said, my wife’s gonna have a child, or had a child or something and he said I’ve got a chance to go over to Elk City and be a fire control officer over there. Because they sell timber year-round and I didn’t think it’d be very good to be in here, you know. In Moose Creek. So that’s fine. He said, Hossick wants you to come up here. He said he thinks the sun rises and sets for you. I said that’s a bunch of baloney, but anyway, why would you want to leave a beautiful district like that? Then he said, he told me, so I says there’s nothing to that. And then this room over here, that’s Blake. Clyde Blake Junior. I had tangled with old Clyde Blake Senior on a pickup deal over at the Cedars, and so I wasn’t very happy with the name Blake at all. I wasn’t taking any crap from him either. So, I knocked at the door, and Blake says Come in, and he said what can I do for you? I said hey, listen I’m going to go to Moose Creek. He said, you are? When? I said just as quick as I can get the hell out of here. He said when are you coming back? I said never. Milo told me, see, I’ll tell you one thing. When Milo came here, he told me, or I came to see Milo, he told me, he said this country is overrun with junk. There’s junk laying from stem to stern. And the Moose Creek District is the worst of all of them.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> Are you talking about Number 9 phone wire?</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> Oh, I’m talking about camp outfits and garbage and everything. All of it, you know, all of the shuckers that they had. They had piles of junk all over hell.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> This the outfitters or Forest Service or?</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> Everything! Don, when you got right down to it, you couldn’t draw the line. And that’s why I say the study that you’re making here; I don’t know which was good buildings or not, because all Milo told me was clean the son of a bitch up. That’s all. He didn’t give a damn whose junk it was. He didn’t want it around. He wanted it to get the hell out of here. And so, that’s what I did. I got into real, real trouble with the crew, because I was burning up the old cabins. But Milo said don’t you save one of them. As a matter of fact, you know the shack down at Three Links? And I was dragging my feet&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> The trappers cabin?</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> the trappers cabin or the old guard station?</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> The old guard station and the trapper&#8217;s cabin.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> There were two of them.</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> There were three.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> Three of them?</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> Yeah. See, I was up there and I looked at the tower on the south side, and the cable had gone down through the top cabin; there was a top cabin you know.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> On Three Links Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> On Three Links Bridge. And so I climbed up there and it was buried in there about that far. When they built it, they didn&#8217;t. The plans called for a plate here and the plate up here on top of the cabin, but they didn&#8217;t do that they just had an old 8 x 10 It was buried. They had a snag broke down off the lower side and hit that and drove her down. I knew we were going to have to have that, So I drug my feet I&#8217;m not coming. And then Milo finally sent word on, he so he said tell Keck that if he hasn&#8217;t got guts enough to burn that cabin up, God dammit, he said, I&#8217;ll do it. Well, I wouldn&#8217;t want the supervisor to tell me that! Especially when he wanted it cleaned up! But, I didn&#8217;t want to impeach on anybody either, so I went down and burned the son of a bitch up, but that was the reason that I held back on that holding, the whole establishment there. And the corral over here, there was a hay barn. And the river went down that way, and behind that was another barn they kept the stock in. They kept the saddle horse and an old shorty, the one that they had in there for pulling stuff around in, you know, in the woods. They had it in there. And this was a big thing, right here. This was right here, and here was this thing up here and on the other side of the river was another shack. So, Don, I don’t know what was good shacks and what was not. I don’t know how much help I can be with… Now, look, you can crucify me, because I… Milo told me to clean the son of a bitch up, period. And so I didn’t pay any attention to the quality or anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> The only important thing now is just getting in the record that there was a cabin here, and this is what it was used for.</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> Yeah, but I don’t know for sure what it was used for. Don, I destroyed an awful lot of stuff. I don’t even know what the hell it was for. But I know the stuff was out there. And there was tin cans laying around and I was told to clean her up. And that was all there was to it. So, when you got one supervisor, you and Rayfield and Sanderson and one right after the other. I wouldn’t impeach on the other supervisor and you wouldn’t do it either. You would say hey, now, don’t you think that you could do away with the chainsaw and kind of do that by hand, and I’d agree with them, you know. But I also had a lot wider and broader assignments from the guy that got me the job to start with, and that was Milo. So, that was the reason. That was the reason. She was cleaned up, and I didn’t pay any attention to who owned what. See, on the way up here, starting right out here at Fenn, you end up there, you didn’t go half a mile past, see what the hell is the name of that creek? There was a cabin up in there and we burnt that Goddamn thing up, and I know… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> It wasn’t just in the wilderness that a cabin was burned. They were burned all over the forest.</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> All over the forest, yeah. That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> So it wasn’t a wilderness issue. I mean I don’t think the cabins were removed because they were in the wilderness; they were removed because they were…</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> Unattractive nuisances. Here’s the thing. People don’t respect the Forest Service and they don’t respect themselves, because they brought a lot of crap in here. And then they went and hunted, and threw the cans over the side and went back out and left it there. And what we wanted to do was just to pick it all up. Clean the thing up and get it, hell, moving out. And we had a hell of a time. A hell of a time. And Rayfield was up there and he said, you know I get the feeling that it’s pretty glum around here. And you know, that poor bastard, he thought that we should make stations all the way up and down the Goddamn river and have the guys dump that stuff there. Why, that’s crazy, because what you’re doing is, you’re leading people into a sin. They’re not supposed to do that. They’re not supposed to treat that beautiful land that way. They’re supposed to come in, have a good time, and take the crap out.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> Well, which kind of leads us around to the subject of the Light Impact Camping.</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> Tell me about that. Its origin on the District and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> Oh, well, as far as I know, it started in Moose Creek. The old lady and I were responsible for it, because we were cleaning up too many outfitters’ camps and so we decided that the best thing to do would be to organize our own crew. And get them on our side. And that was where she started Low Impact Camping. Right there.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> Now it’s spread all the way across the United States, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> Of course it is! It is! Wait until you see Low Impact Camping… you have to do it.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://whistlererin.com/Selway-Podcast-ep38.mp3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Download Podcast</a></p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Matt Root<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Pullman, Washington<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> May 7, 2011</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So how would you describe the early peoples that lived in sort of north central Idaho and you said the Frank Church River of No Return. You’ve done work in the Selway-Bitterroot and then Hells Canyon. Is it just a myriad of different peoples or is there kind of a unifying characteristic or?</p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> Well, the earliest occupations that we’ve investigated in the area are what we call Clovis and these are people with large spear points, fluted. They hunted mammoth, extinct forms of bison. I’ve excavated the Wenatchee, East Wenatchee Clovis site where there were large Clovis points about 18-19 cm long with carved mammoth bone placed in probably a ceremonial offering. Ken Reid and I just published a small paper on a Clovis point from Hells Canyon and that provides evidence for the earliest occupation of Hells Canyon. And in calendar years that’s about 13,000, 13,500 years ago. There are probably earlier occupations out there. There are slightly earlier occupations known in Oregon and elsewhere in North America but those are the earliest people in Washington, North Idaho.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Okay, wow. So you went back and did some digs in the upper Selway in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness. Can you just talk about what it was that you were supposed to do there and maybe some of the things that you found.</p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> There is a site that is at the confluence of [Name Withheld]* Creek and the Selway River. When the Selway River has high flows in the springtime with spring rains and snow melt the river flows against the bank and erodes, the sediment erodes the river terrace. Now there’s an archeological site in that river terrace and every time the river erodes that cutbank and takes sediment away it leaves artifacts strewn on the beach and I think it was 1995 Forest Service archeologists were essentially doing an inventory, looking for archeological sites along the river, and they found this site. As it turns out this is a place where a Nez Perce elder whose English name is Billy Williams, Billy William, I’m sorry. He was interviewed by Alice Fletcher who was an ethnographer from Washington, D.C., and in the 1880s she had Billy William draw a map of North Idaho, Washington, actually more North Idaho even down into the Snake River Plain where he drew all the rivers, the major rivers, the Columbia, the Snake, the Clearwater and hundreds of their tributaries and he placed 76, I believe, Nez Perce villages that were occupied in the 1700-1800s and gave most of them their Nez Perce name. At the place on his map where through comparing with modern maps we’ve determined to be at the confluence of [Name Withheld] Creek and the Selway River he placed a dot and he called that village Ne’hu-lat-pu and this was part of the Sal-wah’-poo Village group on what historically was known as the upper Clearwater but now what we call the Selway River and the Sal-wah’-poo means people of the Sal-wah so Ne’hu-lat-pu is one of the older villages within the Sal-wah’-poo and Billy William mentioned that this village group was the oldest village group amongst the Nez Perce. This is where the long ago Nez Perce lived. And where he placed that dot on his map in the 1880s is where this archeological site was found in 1995 and we’re fairly confident that this is the village of Ne’hu-lat-pu. There are what we call house pits, circular depressions in the river terrace that mark the place, mark the places of Nez Perce pit houses. These will be houses that had their foundations dug several feet own into the ground and then mats, grass mats would be erected on a pole framework and this was the traditional winter village type of Nez Perce and other people on the plateau.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So you date those impressions to approximately what year?</p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> The radiocarbon dates we have that we think are associated with those house pits run from about A.D. 1300 into the 1600s. And now our excavations are only along the river bank. We were tasked by the Forest Service to find out what kind of artifacts were being threatened, that were eroding and being threatened with further erosion, how old they might be, how deep they were. And so we did not do any excavations within these house pits themselves because they are a few meters back away from the edge and our excavations were just along the cut bank. The idea is that we wanted to disturb as little of the site as possible and the Nez Perce have concerns about the site and it’s a culturally sensitive site and we did not want to dig in any of the house pits because they’re not immediately threatened by destruction and the Nez Perce would just as soon that we not dig in their ancestral house pits unless it’s absolutely necessary. But, so, but we think that those later dates from the 1300s on to the 1600s and possibly into the 1700s would date those house pits and that’s concordant with what Billy William had also mentioned. He said that it was abandoned just before Lewis and Clark stumbled out of the Bitterroot Mountain cold and hungry and were taken in by the Nez Perce.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, but then there’s also evidence of much older occupation, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> There are artifacts that we have found in excavations below the levels that we’ve dated to A.D. 1300 but there’s few artifacts. We don’t have anything that we can get a radiocarbon date from so far. We’ve only found one small dart point in those lower levels and that may only be a few thousand years old. We have found other artifact types on the beach below the cut bank that may be as much as 6,000 years old. They’re certainly probably at least about 4,500 years old. They’re large side notched dart points.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So do you know if these communities were occupied just during the summer months or did people overwinter there?</p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> Actually the pattern ethnographically is where the people overwintered. Now, archeologically we don’t have any evidence of what season that they occupied these villages but traditionally people would have been in the mat villages during the winter. In the springtime when the snow would thaw people would start at the lower elevations collecting edible plants, roots, and they would and then when the fish runs would begin in spring, on the Clearwater those were a little bit later, but as soon as the fish would start to run in this area in the Clearwater. People might move down out of the Selway River to the Clearwater to lower elevations to gather spring, the spring crops and fish when they came in May and then people would essentially move upward in elevation as spring progresses upward through the mountains and so people were away from their villages fishing, hunting, gathering foods as they became available at the different elevations throughout the spring, summer, and then into the fall with the fall fish runs and fall hunts. And then after the fall fish runs and fall hunts and gathering berries in the fall people would move back to the aggregated villages along the major streams like the Selway, Clearwater, Snake, Columbia where they would live off stored foods.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah. It just, maybe I’m mistaken, but the upper Selway seems like a pretty harsh environment to live year around. Is that, that doesn’t strike you as being odd because it would seem like a lower elevation site might be. It says something about the people who stayed there over winter about how they can endure those pretty harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p><strong>MR:</strong> Right, and the modern environmental and weather data that we have for this area shows that this little area on the confluence of [Name Withheld]* Creek is really a little bit warmer than it is on the lower, farther down on the Clearwater. And if you move much farther up on the Selway it gets considerably colder. It’s also in a slight rain shadow and so it’s a little bit drier and it’s a little bit warmer than other places. But, you’re right, it is a relatively high elevation for a winter village but people were there. And, of course, the other thing to remember is that it was abandoned probably in the 1700s and remember Billy William had drawn in 70 some Nez Perce villages and, of course, when Lewis and Clark came through there were not over 70 Nez Perce villages left. You know, people were ravaged by diseases. There were diseases, epidemic diseases came through the area almost every generation, you know. We know there was a large epidemic in 1780 and there was probably epidemics before that. We know there were epidemics on the upper Missouri before any French fur trappers ever came to trade, to trade with the Mandan.</p>

Dennis Baird attended Michigan State University and the University of Hawaii, and obtained graduate degrees from the University of Michigan and Michigan State University, where he witnessed the very first Earth Day in Ann Arbor. While in high school and college, he traveled extensively in Europe and Southeast Asia, as well as serving for a year in Vietnam. When he finished school, he taught at Southern Illinois University and became involved in conservation, helping to establish the first wilderness area in Illinois: Crab Orchard Wilderness. After moving to Idaho in 1974 to work at the University of Idaho Library, Dennis joined the conservation efforts in establishing both the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness and the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. In addition to pursuing his passions for historical preservation at the UI Library, and fine wine at his locally owned business, The Wine Company in Moscow, Dennis continues to advocate for wilderness protection in Idaho.",1964 Wilderness Act; Dennis Baird,https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/selway-podcast-ep36.mp3?_=9,Dennis Baird in front of Elk Mountain.

<strong>Location:</strong> Moscow, Idaho<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> February 27, 2013</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Talk a little bit more abstractly about boundaries. What do wilderness boundaries mean? Are they, obviously, you can’t build a road within the boundaries, but how do they relate to what’s on the other side of the boundaries? In your opinion.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> Well, they’re kind of a mythical thing, in some ways. It’s like building a wall to keep trouble out and keep good things in. Not to keep people out, but I see a wilderness boundary as a place where society has put money in the bank and drew the line around the bank so everybody knows just how much money is available to be kept in there. It tells you, it sets the limit to the amount of money that you just saved. Because the reason for wilderness is not for recreation, although people recreate there. It’s not for hunting, that’s fine. The creatures that live in the wilderness don’t know that they’re in one, and probably don’t care, but people know that society has made this decision to not use up some resource. To defer, maybe, because wilderness can be undone. A new congress can undo any wilderness area, and have it pillaged tomorrow. But it’s a decision by society to set some limits on society. That’s what those lines are. That’s why the lines need to be big, in my opinion, because you want to save more than you need. You can’t save too much. The way the world’s society in general uses up resources these days, we probably are way, way short of wilderness worldwide, and even here in the United States, where we have a pretty good wilderness system, we don’t have anywhere near enough, and we’re going to regret how little we have. But the boundaries represent the size of the savings account. That’s what my view of wilderness boundary is. What you can do in a wilderness, it’s important. And the law. The Wilderness Act is a really good law, written by some great visionaries. Wonderful people. Howard Zahniser and Bob Marshall and… mostly Howard Zahniser and it wisely keeps things peaceful and quiet, and minimizes the ability of land managers to disturb things. It doesn’t stop land management; it doesn’t stop people’s use. It just sets some limits on it within the notion of saving things. But the real reason to have a wilderness area and have a big one is that old notion that we as a society have decided that we’re just not going to spend this resource. We’re going to save this resource. We’re going to invest it. Maybe we’re going to be leaving, I would hope, a decision or two for our children. Wilderness is, the notion of setting aside wilderness is a sign of great optimism for one’s hope about the intelligence of the next generation. You always hope that your kids are going to be smarter than you are. That’s always my hope anyway. I think it’s going to turn out that way. You never know, but if they’re smarter, you’ve got to have some decisions left to apply those smarts to. If we’ve made all the decisions as far as natural resources go to use up everything, to modify everything, to degrade everything, then as smart as they are they won’t have anything left that they can decide on. We ought to, we owe them the maximizing the places where their brighter intelligence, their smarts, better than ours can be applied. So that’s the other reason for wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> There might be things in the wilderness that we can’t see now. That need to be studied, and looked at, and valued that we in this generation cannot even see it.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> No. We’re kind of stupid. We don’t have a clue. There’s all sorts of things out there. There’s certainly anthropological things in wilderness that we know nothing about. In my wandering around the woods, and yours too, in all weathers we’ve stumbled upon, well, what’s this? And it’s human. An artifact of some sort that we have no understanding of. There’s any number of American Indian sites in the Selway country that are totally undocumented, totally un-understood, not misunderstood, totally no understanding whatsoever. I’ve seen lots of them. You’ve seen them. Other have seen them. You look at them and say, that’s interesting. What do you suppose that is? Well, that’s an obvious thing that’s out there that we don’t know anything about, let alone the best way to manage it, so one would assume that if you don’t know how to manage it then you’d try and keep it so it didn’t need management.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Right. And those artifacts might be anywhere on the landscape in the United States, but a lot of what we have has been covered up.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> Yep.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So we’ll never see it. With buildings, and roads, and farming and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> And even in protected areas that’s happened. There was an interesting study on wildlife habitat that was devised maybe ten or twelve years ago by some scientists. Which creature was the topic of the study doesn’t matter, but they looked for some undisturbed sites around the country where this animal lived, so that they could use them as a base line. This was an undisturbed habitat, and they were confident that the National Park System have a vast amount of sites that fit that bill. Undisturbed, wonderful wildlife habitat, and quickly discovered that even within the National Parks there has been so much interest in development: lodge building and road building and making things easier to reach for tourists and so on, that many of the most valuable, best possible sites for the study of this animal had been obliterated. Even in the National parks. And the same study concluded that the very best places left for that kind of study, if you needed a baseline, undisturbed site, that had been undisturbed for a long time, almost all those sites were within the National Forest Wilderness Preservation System.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://whistlererin.com/Selway-Podcast-ep36.mp3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Download Podcast</a></p>

An experienced backcountry pilot, “Whitey” Hachmeister attempted to land the plane on one of the sandbars on the Selway river, but the wing caught a tree, spinning the plane out of control. The crash killed eight of the passengers and both pilots, and caused the US Forest Service to completely re-think their policy of using aircraft to transport seasonal workers and supplies to backcountry locations such as Moose Creek, and revert to primitive methods such as pack strings or backpacking.

Nels Jensen, himself a backcountry pilot and friend of Whitey, remembers the crash vividly as he was one of the first on the scene and assisted extensively in the search and rescue afterward. A native Montanan, Nels worked for the Forest Service first as a smokejumper, and then as a bush pilot throughout the 1970’s and 1980’s. Today, he still flies into the back country, and is an active member of the Recreational Air Field Foundation.

<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Nels Jensen<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Charlo, Montana.<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> October 5, 2011</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Okay. So have you had any close, have you, do you have any stories that particularly stand out for you of injured people you hauled out?</p>
<p><strong>NJ:</strong> Let’s go down the river.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Oh, okay, let’s go down the river.</p>
<p><strong>NJ:</strong> We’re working our way down the river. Okay. And back in 1969 [correction: 1979] I was flying a, I was doing a recon, fire recon in a Beech Baron when I heard a distress call from a DC-3. And it was Whitey Hachmeister and he was in deep trouble with a DC-3. And I flew directly, I wasn’t that far away because it was over on the edge of the Clearwater. And they had taken off from Grangeville and they had, and I don’t know how many people were on board. There’s a list of the people that were killed right there. But anyway about halfway up above Selway Falls he experienced a rough engine and came up to needle power and blew a cylinder on the one engine. The other engine had a crankshaft seize I believe and it slung the prop clear off the thing and it shook the engine clear off the airplane. He had no power. He did a dead stick landing into the Selway River and he, it was the only stretch, it’s below Moose Creek, but just on final he hit his left wing on a tree about eight inches wide and that turned the fuselage on that airplane so instead of hitting square it hit to the side and, of course, the river was high at that time and his decision to go in there, in retrospect he probably would have been better off to go up in the timber somewhere but, you know, he went to the river. I got there with the Beech Baron just after he hit, okay, and there was debris and bodies everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> This was in 19?</p>
<p><strong>NJ:</strong> ’79.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> ’79. Oh, okay, so you were like one of the first on the scene?</p>
<p><strong>NJ:</strong> I was the first one on the scene. Anyway, I remember circling, talking to Lowell Hanson who had three guys on that rock in the center of the river trying to save them and trying to figure out what, you know, what we were going to do next, okay. Anyway, Chuck told me to, Chuck Kern was a regional coordinator at the time, I told him I was coming back to Missoula. I wanted to land at Moose Creek but I knew if I landed at Moose Creek with that Baron I could never get it out of there. So I ran back to Missoula and grabbed the Cessna 206 and flew back over the scene again. Lowell was still on that rock. He’d lost Andy, one of the guys had died. And by that time, you know, the Nez Perce was trying to coordinate the rescue and I went back to Moose Creek and landed and turned around on the upper end of the strip and this young kid was walking up the strip. He was one of the survivors. He’d walked clear up the south side of that river. You couldn’t believe where he’d walked. Anyway, by that time Hillcrest Aviation had, but anyway they had their helicopters. We had a couple of helicopters by then and they were working on the rescue and I went from there down, they wanted me to go get the sheriff, okay, and so I flew in to Grangeville and the sheriff weighed about 350 pounds and I put him on and flew him back up to the scene. By that time the Forest Service had several people at the scene and they had a semblance of an organization at Moose Creek and I brought that big sheriff in and it was kind of a funny story but it isn’t, I mean under the circumstance it wasn’t funny at all, but he went in to the main Moose Creek eating area in the back and they were organizing things and he stepped in and told them he was there and the sheriff is the one that’s in charge of all search and rescue and he told them he was there and he would take over now. And the Forest Service people that were there got very irate with him and he said well you can either let me take you over or Nels will start hauling you to jail and that was the end of the subject right there, okay. He took the whole search and rescue over. I went from there to, back to Grangeville that day. By that time I had flown for the Boise Fire Center for several years. By that time the Boise Fire Center 212 and 500 helicopter were in Grangeville. We threw all of our stuff in the 212 and headed up the river that day. It was getting toward evening. Had a pilot named Lee Young that I knew real well that was with, I was flying with him. And we landed on a sandbar just down below the accident and set the camp up. And then we spent 14 days.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> And it was flying out or packing bodies out or?</p>
<p><strong>NJ:</strong> Bodies and debris.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah.</p>
<p><strong>NJ:</strong> It took us 14 days. We took everything out of that river. We shut the river down.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> For rafters?</p>
<p><strong>NJ:</strong> For rafters and we kept it down. It took us 14 days to find Whitey. We finally found Whitey.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> That must have been exhausting.</p>
<p><strong>NJ:</strong> Anyway, Mike Izuko, the smoke jumper that I told you helped maintain all the air fields, he was a very integral part of that. And Emil and Penny, they came down. We couldn’t get the DC-3 out of the river. It was, the water was so high and the weight on that.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>NJ:</strong> So Emil, we set a jib pole up and Emil, we pulled, we broke a lot of cable, but we finally pulled that thing up enough that we could get to it and then we brought a 107 crane, no, it wasn’t a crane. It was a 107 in and he finally, we chopped it up enough that he was finally able to lift it. The last thing we had to get was the engine and that was really important because we were trying to determine what happened to the airplane and so what they did is I put a wet suit on and they had a search and rescue team that worked with us all the time we were up there and they floated me under water past the engine so I could determine whether it was feathered or not and then we finally got our hands on it and we lifted it out. We hauled all this stuff down the Selway, there’s a big sandbar just above Fenn and that’s where we hauled this stuff and we got semis in there and we got it up. We got everything out of there as fast as we could so.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, did that accident change Forest Service practices back in the back country at all?</p>
<p><strong>NJ:</strong> Well, you know, the DC-3 wasn’t used until we got turbines on. We turbinized two DC-3s and we’ve been running those in there ever since, you know, but it did for a long period of time. It was a very, very much of a blow and a shock to the Forest Service and aviation so.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://whistlererin.com/Selway-Podcast-ep35.mp3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Download Podcast</a></p>

<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Anna Bengtson<br />
<strong>Interviewers:</strong> Karen Houppert, Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> May 22, 2011<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Moose Creek Ranger Station</p>
<p><strong>KH:</strong> So tell me how long are you back here and how do you get mail.</p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> It depends for me. I sometimes stay back for one to two months at a time and, you know, it just kind of depends on what’s going on, if it’s a little more, it’s becoming a little more office stuff that needs to be done. But ideally I just stay back here for a lot of the summer and just go out as needed. We get all of our food and mail by pack string. We’ve got a packer that comes in every two weeks, Pete, Pete Armicardy, and he comes from Fenn Ranger Station is his base and then the end of the road is another 15 miles there.</p>
<p><strong>KH:</strong> So what’s a pack string?</p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> It is, he rides a horse and then he pulls behind him about eight or nine mules, it depends, seven to nine mules depending on how much stuff is coming in and those are all packed with boxes, you know, he manties up loads. A mule can carry about a fifth of its weight so mules are, you know, around 1,000 to 1,300 pounds so they can carry quite a bit of weight in. We try to do it traditionally, you know, we do have occasional administrative flights that come in to since we have an airstrip here but in the past there was a time when they did a lot more administrative flights and then they reevaluated that just safetywise and we did have a couple big plane crashes that killed Forest Service personnel and then.</p>
<p><strong>KH:</strong> What’s administrative, what do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> Just Forest Service flights, you know. If, you know, I always either hike in or ride a horse but in the past it would be I would have just gone to the airport in Grangeville and flown in, you know, that would be an option if we did do more administrative flights because.</p>
<p><strong>KH:</strong>K: And what would, if you had to name kind of like the single most thing that attracted you to like being up here in the wilderness what would you say?</p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> Hum.</p>
<p><strong>KH:</strong> What draws you most?</p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> Well, it depends because, you know, the word that comes to my mind is freedom but I mean when you’re doing this for a job you don’t always have freedom but I think that for like wilderness I guess solitude and freedom are things that I really value about being out in the wilderness and with a job like this you don’t get that as much but it’s still just I guess being in the natural world and kind of being able to be here for numerous seasons and kind of learn a place and, you know, get to know which wildflowers pop up in the spring and where to find the morel mushrooms and just kind of both getting to know the natural beauty of a place and then with Moose Creek it’s getting to learn I think a lot of the history. I’ve really enjoyed that about being in those places, both kind of merging the past with the present and trying to keep Moose Creek going the same way it was, you know, that it’s been for decades and it’s, you know, obviously things are going to change but I really value that, like having a back country station and that was the same with the Bob Marshall too, just using those back country stations as work centers in the same way that they have always been. I feel like they’re really valuable to have in the back country. I know it’s, you know, contrary to wilderness in a way as well as the airstrip but I think we can do a lot more for the wilderness in managing the wilderness having these stations back here.</p>
<p><strong>KH:</strong> And is there something I haven’t asked you that you think is important to know or you feel like when people ask you about like oh, wow, you work for the Forestry Service and they usually get the wrong idea or like what, you know, or do people have a reaction when you say that?</p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> I think a lot of people just don’t understand the concept of being stationed out this far, you know, and I think this is different with the airstrip because you can get in here in 30 minutes in a plane but for most of the people that come in or a lot of the people and the Forest Service people it takes a long time to come in and I think, you know, we get volunteer hosts that come in for a month at a time and I try to recruit hosts and even some of them they just don’t quite get that concept of there’s no road here, you know, it takes a long time to get in here and it does take a lot of effort to supply the station and just to, you know, there’s people that live here for their whole summer like the MCC crew they stay back here a lot of the summer. We have a satellite for emergencies but we don’t have phone communication. We only have letter communication and then the two-way radios for the most part and I think, you know, we don’t have Internet. A lot of people, whereas at the Selway Lodge they do have Internet so it’s a little different but I think it’s just hard.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> As we know because when Mark goes do you want to check your Internet and I’m like Karen we shouldn’t but as soon as we got in their house we went.</p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> Yah, I know and it’s hard, it would be the same way if we ever had Internet here, you know. It’s just one of those things that’s a distraction that’s hard not to do it. But, yah, I think that’s probably what people the most don’t understand about my job is like how far in it really is. And you were ask, the original question was the mail and I never.</p>
<p><strong>KH:</strong> Oh, right, right. Explain the mail, yah.</p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> The mail gets delivered to the post office in Kooskia, Idaho, which is about 20 or 25 miles downriver from Fenn Ranger Station, our main ranger station, and so the postal service drives it up to Fenn, drops it off there, and then Pete he picks it up. He usually drives up to the end of the road, the trailhead, the night before he’s going to come in here so he’ll pick it up from the office at Fenn, drive up it to the trailhead, pack it up with all the other supplies coming in, and then he comes in in a day and so he delivers it.</p>
<p><strong>KH:</strong> With the mules, by a mule?</p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> Yup. And it is, it’s a fun day when he comes in because everyone gets excited both about the fresh food and mail, you know. I think that’s the main connection with the outside world for people that are working back here and it’s really exciting to get a care package or a letter from somebody, a friend or somebody you love.</p>
<p><strong>KH:</strong> And I can imagine when they forget to bring the mail that.</p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> Yah, you’re kind of like looking, you don’t want to say anything at first, like it’s got to be here and then, Pete, did you get the mail. Oh, shoot, I forgot the mail. That’s okay I’ll come in in a couple more weeks.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep34.mp3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Download Podcast</a></p>

Dale graduated from the University of Illinois in the 1960’s and began work in the forests of the Pacific Northwest just after the passage of the 1964 Wilderness Act.

On September 14, 1805, Clark wrote in his journal of the exhausting trip:

“9 miles over a high mountain steep &amp; almost inaxcessible much falling timber which fatigues our men &amp; horses exceedingly, in stepping over so great a number of logs added to the steep assents and [descents] of the mountains . . . rained and snowed &amp; hailed the greater part of the day all wet and cold”

Before entering the mountains, the Corps of Discovery stayed at a camp in the Bitterroot Valley that they called Travelers’ Rest. This area had been used for many years by the Native Americans as a campsite. The Corps stayed at Travelers’ Rest upon their return journey as well, making this site one of the landmarks of the expedition. In 2001, after archaeologists used the now-published Lewis and Clark journals to determine more precise locations for the camp sites used on the historic journey, Dale began volunteering at <a href=""http://www.travelersrest.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Travelers’ Rest State Park</a> telling visitors about the Lewis and Clark journey, and detailing the findings of recent archaeological discovery.

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Dale Dufour<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Lolo, Montana<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> September 20, 2011.</p>
<p><strong>DL: </strong>What, can you talk a little bit about Lewis and Clark’s journey through this part of the country because I know that it was the most difficult part of the journey and maybe some of the incidents that stand out for you in, at least in, along this part of the wilderness?</p>
<p><strong>DD:</strong> Well, you know, after they met the Shoshone and were able to get horses their thought at first was to go down the Salmon River because they knew that was a tributary, anadromous fishery. They knew from being with the Indians that that led into the Columbia and so, but the Indians told them it was too rugged, they couldn’t go. But Clark took a party and went down into the vicinity of Shoop, Idaho, now and agreed that they couldn’t go that way so that’s when they came back, got back with Lewis and they had an Indian who they called Little Toby that was, came as a guide with his son with him and they came across near Lost Trail Pass today and when they got into the head of the Bitterroot River they encountered about 400 Salish that were on their way to buffalo hunt and they traded some of their poorer horses that they had acquired for better ones and then they made their way down the Bitterroot River until they got here in Lolo. And they arrived at what is now called Traveler’s Rest State Park on the 9th of September in 1805 and were here the 10th and the 11th and left on the afternoon of the 11th. They’d lost their horses in the morning, took them all day to round them up, and then they went on up the what we now call the Nimiipu Trail, the Lolo Trail and over the top and on to meet with the, they met with the Nez Perce and went on down. And when they came back they got back to this area and on the 30th of June in 1806 and they stayed at Traveler’s Rest. It was named Traveler’s Rest by Lewis in the journals. And they got her on the 30th of June and were here the 1st, the 2nd, and the 3rd of July. And this is where they split up on the way back and Clark took a party of 23 and went back up the Bitterroot to where Sula is now and then he headed from there to the southeast up over the Continental Divide and to what they had called Camp Fortunate near Dillon where they’d cached their canoes. And Lewis took nine men from here and went down from Traveler’s Rest, went down from their camp site about a half mile, crossed the creek, and paralleled the Bitterroot River to where now the Bitterroot and the Clark Fork come together and he crossed it there and went through essentially what’s downtown Missoula, on up the Blackfoot, and over the top. So we have a lot of interest in this area on the Lewis and Clark and the fact that one of the toughest parts of their journey was going through the Selway-Bitterroot country. And they found out that trails aren’t always the easiest to follow and there’s just a lot of fascinating information out there about their trek through this part of the world.</p>
<p><strong>DL: </strong>And didn’t they, they almost starved at one point? They had to kill some.</p>
<p><strong>DD:</strong> They had a difficult time hunting. While they were here they were able to kill some deer but as soon as they started up the trail game got more scarce, made them eventually having to kill some of their horses and at the bottom, of course, of the other side of the west side of the pass is what was called Colt Killed Creek and changed to White Sands and now it’s back to Colt Killed again. And that wasn’t the only horse that they had to eat I guess but, yah, hunting was not what people envision. They just feel game was everywhere. It wasn’t like out on the Plains.</p>
<p><strong>DL: </strong>Right, and were elk in this area at that time or? I don’t think they’re mentioned in the journals.</p>
<p><strong>DD:</strong> No, they talk about deer but.</p>
<p><strong>DL: </strong>And grouse maybe.</p>
<p><strong>DD:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>DL: </strong>Yah. Uhm, I remember Patrick Gass in his journals said at the top of Lolo he called the Bitterroots &#8220;the most terrible mountains I have ever beheld.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>DD:</strong> Yah. Tremendous mountains.</p>
<p><strong>DL: </strong>Yah.</p>
<p><strong>DD:</strong> They called them.</p>
<p><strong>DL: </strong>Yah. And.</p>
<p><strong>DD:</strong> And we were at, we talk about weather changes. Well, there was a mini-Ice Age that was in the early 1800s was winding down and so it only takes a few degrees temperature to make a huge difference in the amount of snow and how long it, when it comes and how long it stays and so they encountered a lot more snow then. I think they figured the end of that mini-Ice Age was about 1855.</p>
<p><strong>DL: </strong>So they were there in the thick of it.</p>
<p><strong>DD:</strong> They were there. Well, they were still feeling the effects of cooler weather.</p>
<p><strong>DL: </strong>Uh-huh. So why are you so interested in the Lewis and Clark journey?</p>
<p><strong>DD:</strong> Uhm, I’ve lived here in Lolo since ’94 and I didn’t know much about it at all and I heard about a meeting of the local chapter of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation and so I joined that organization in about ’95 or somewhere in there and then when, when the hunt was on to find the Lewis and Clark actual camp site I used to go over here to the Park area now where it was. It’s the only archaeologically proven camp site on the entire trail from St. Louis to the Coast. And, see originally it was designated a National Historic Landmark without a site. They just had a sign on the highway in 1960. And then in 1976 three historians got together, nobody knows what they used for their information but they said well the camp site was at the mouth of the creek where it goes into the Bitterroot River and it stood that way for many years. But the journals weren’t readily available for people to read. They were out there but not published. And when Dr. Gary Moulten from Nebraska University published the journals in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, as soon as you read you knew that they didn’t camp at the mouth of the creek.</p>
<p><strong>DL: </strong>And what creek are you talking about:</p>
<p><strong>DD:</strong> Lolo Creek.</p>
<p><strong>DL: </strong>Lolo Creek, okay.</p>
<p><strong>DD:</strong> Which Lewis named Traveler’s Rest Creek. The Salish called it Tomsunklee which means No Salmon Creek. But after people realized that they probably didn’t camp at the mouth of the creek and they started hunting for the site up here things started coming together and the first item that was found was a military button in 1998 and then a couple years later in 2001 the archaeologists came in with a magnetometer to comb through the area that turned out to be the camp site and it shows them, the magnetometer shows areas of disturbance where either ground has been dug or there’s been real hot fires and so they were able to using their technology find two of the three cook fires. They also found the latrine site and they recovered rock that was cracked from the heat of the fire and charcoal which was carbon dated and a tiny trade bead and the men were melting lead, pouring bullets, and they spilled some of that. Scientists at MIT analyzed the isotopes from the lead in tracing it, it like a fingerprint from a person, back to the mines in Kentucky where the military got their lead. So there’s a, it’s sort of like a CSI here in Lolo and they also, they found the latrine which was a 15 foot 3 inch long trench that had organic matter in it and they knew that two of the men were ill because they came back from the Coast and were taking medicine that was 60% mercury and mercury doesn’t disappear. So they had a device and found mercury about five inches beneath the organic layer.</p>
<p><strong>DL: </strong>Wow.</p>
<p><strong>DD:</strong> So there’s a whole bunch of things that’s what the archaeologists called the preponderance of evidence.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep33.mp3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Download Podcast</a></p>

sbw331,A Lumber Camp and Bob Marshall,"January 21, 2013",2013-01-21,Episode 32,sbw331.mp3,8:13,"In this episode, titled “A Lumber Camp and Bob Marshall,” Karen Houppert reads several anecdotal excerpts from letters written by Bob Marshall. The reading takes place in the relaxed, storytelling style along the scenic Selway River with the sound of the river in the background.

Bob Marshall served as the chief of forestry in the Bureau of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1937, and the head of recreation management in the Forest Service from 1937 to 1939. While serving in these two posts, Bob proposed the idea of a formal, national association dedicated to wilderness preservation, and was one of the founding members of The Wilderness Society, which twenty-five years later fostered the 1964 Wilderness Act. In 1935, Bob classified the Selway-Bitteroot the “greatest of all” U.S. wildlands for its natural and historical significance. He crusaded tirelessly for the area’s protection and single-handedly prevented the construction of a major roadway through the area; in fact, he gave so much energy to protecting the Selway-Bitterroot, the wilderness was originally supposed to bear his name. Bob Marshall is also considered by many to be responsible for starting the wilderness preservation movement in America.

These excerpts show a lighter side of Bob Marshall’s outlook, as he relates some his own time spent in the wilderness. This obviously led to many of his opinions regarding the preservation of the natural landscape for future generations.",Bob Marshall,https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/selway-project-ep32b.mp3?_=3,"Bob Marshall, 1920’s",https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bob-whiskers-postcard-web1.jpg,sbw331_img.jpg,"[{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/bob_live.jpg"",""id"":""772"",""title"":""bob_live"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Bob Marshall"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/bob_marshall_camping.jpg"",""id"":""773"",""title"":""Bob_Marshall_camping"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Bob Marshall backpacking. ca. 1930."",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/bob-marshall.jpg"",""id"":""774"",""title"":""Bob-Marshall"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Bob Marshall, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 1930\u0026#8217;s."",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/bob-whiskers-postcard-web1.jpg"",""id"":""775"",""title"":""Bob-whiskers-postcard-web1"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Bob Marshall, 1920\u0026#8217;s"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/experiment-station.jpg"",""id"":""776"",""title"":""Experiment-Station"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Bob Marshal near Priest Lake Experiment Station. 1920\u0026#8217;s"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/timber.jpg"",""id"":""777"",""title"":""timber"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Bob Marshall Examining Timber stands near Priest Lake.

<p><strong>Reader:</strong> Karen Houppert (with Debbie Lee)<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Selway River<br />
<strong>Date: </strong>2012</p>
<p><strong>KH:</strong> All right, so I’m going to read a little bit from Bob Marshall’s diary, or journal. The first excerpt is a short one from Dalkina Camp One, Kaniksu National Forest, Idaho, October 9, 1926.<br />
“The food at the camp has been fine. I’ve only had to break my diet once, and that not very seriously. All my life, I’ve never really received a first-rate cut; therefore any remarks I might make about lacerations lack the basis of wide experience. But nevertheless, it would be worth remarking that the other evening, I received a most interesting laceration of my life. I was reaching gently for a piece of bread when, simultaneously, an old lumberjack set out to spear a chunk with his fork in the common lumber camp manner. Fork and hand collided at the brink of the plate, and two of the tines punctured my skin. So, you see, even so unexciting an episode as eating has its perils.”</p>
<p><strong>DL: </strong>[Chuckles] What year was that?</p>
<p><strong>KH:</strong> 1926.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>KH:</strong> This next one I’m going to read is a bit longer. It’s an excerpt in the life of the Priest River Experiment Station, October 17, 1926.</p>
<p>“Thirteen days in a lumber camp and how were they spent? Well, I could write a detailed account of the methods employed and the objectives sought in laying out permanent samples: R 5 MC 102, 121, but this would be of interest only to foresters, and to damn few of them. Though I will glide over rapidly the pleasure at least one forester derived in helping select a typical ten-acre area on which to study in detail that method of cutting most prevalent of the Western white pine type.”</p>
<p>And then he actually goes on to give the description which actually is quite boring, so I’m going to skip it. So, he goes on to say,</p>
<p>“The average day would probably be of greater interest. At 5:45, the flunky pounds the iron triangle outside the cookshack for half a minute, and we roll out. There are several of us sleeping in a little 15 x 15 scalers shack. The five in our party and two foremen working on brush disposal. There’s a single and a double bunk, and one of the fellows has brought a light Army cot. Two are suspended high among the rafters on a spring and mattress resting up there, while I am stowed away in one corner of the floor on my air mattress. The cabin is well ventilated, especially low down, so the crowd has no adverse affect on sleep. One of the foremen gets up half an hour before rising time, and lights a fire in the stove, which makes dressing more comfortable on these cool mornings. At six fifteen, the triangle is pounded again, and the men, about forty in all, pour out from four or five shacks and head for the mess hall. Dalkina Camp One is one of the minority among lumber camps, for it still prohibits talking at meals. As a result, in a quarter of an hour, everyone is out again, having disposed of a good meal too fast for pleasure or health. At seven, we leave for work, five minutes away, and are busily engaged on our ten acres until an hour before noon. Then, back to the camp, and dash through lunch, in which Wiedman, a brush-burner named Teft and I, were always far behind the rest. We received nothing worse than black looks from the cooks, however, and so eating at a pace somewhat resembling the proper. Then, the meal is digested with talk and reading until noon, when we set out to work again. Four more hours fly by, and we go back when the work’s done. At four fifteen, another meal, and at four thirty-three, at worst, or rather, best, it is all in the stomach.”</p>
<p>I’m going to go skip ahead a little here, to …and now he’s talking about, he’s preparing some meals, and he says, I’m skipping ahead a bit,</p>
<p>“At about eight o’clock, Ed Person and Chris Peterson, the old farmers, return. Around nine fifteen, I would prepare my fourth meal of the day, in which I was sometimes joined by the other fellows. By nine thirty, the gas lamps would be turned off, the windows opened, and seven forms stretched out in the horizontal.”</p>

sbw313,Dear Mother and Father,"January 21, 2013",2013-01-21,Episode 31,sbw313.mp3,7:59,"In this episode, titled, “Dear Mother and Father,” we hear the reading of a letter now preserved in the Library of Congress, written by one of the early chiefs of the Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot.

Gifford Pinchot graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale University in 1889. His father, whose fortune came from timber and land sales, urged Gifford to join the new forestry movement, to become a forester and to begin developing concepts of long-term forest management. Because of the family wealth, Gifford was able to pursue this passion full-time. He served in various political offices including the chief of the Division of Forestry, what would be later named the United States Forest Service, and as the governor of Pennsylvania, working closely with Theodore Roosevelt. Although he supported forest management, he never went so far as to support preservation of wilderness for the sake of scenery, a policy which put him at odds with idealists such as John Muir, but which won him more political support as he attempted to put more wilderness land under the protection of the federal government to preserve as a resource to the growing country’s economy.

Gifford Pinchot wrote this letter to his parents in 1896, shortly after his graduation from university. His father had sent him to tour the great western forests as inspiration for his future life’s work, and his decision on this particular trip to spend some weeks in the Bitterroot mountains rather than to accompany John Muir to the Alaskan wilderness would impact his future policies and rhetoric. Additionally, this handwritten letter offers a fascinating glimpse into the culture and times of the western United States just before the turn of the twentieth century.",Gifford Pinchot,https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/selway-podcast-ep31.mp3?_=4,Gifford Pinchot,https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gifford-pinchot.jpg,sbw313_img.jpg,"[{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/220px-pinchot_roosevelt.jpg"",""id"":""780"",""title"":""220px-Pinchot_Roosevelt"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Gifford Pinchot and Theodore Roosevelt"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/784px-gifford_pinchot_3c03915u.jpg"",""id"":""781"",""title"":""784px-Gifford_Pinchot_3c03915u"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""1909, by Pirie MacDonald, when Pinchot was the first Chief of the United States Forest Service."",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/gifford-pinchot.jpg"",""id"":""782"",""title"":""gifford pinchot"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Gifford Pinchot"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/letter1.jpg"",""id"":""783"",""title"":""Letter1"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Page 1 of Gifford Pinchot\u0026#8217;s letter"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/letter2.jpg"",""id"":""784"",""title"":""Letter2"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Page 4 of Gifford Pinchot\u0026#8217;s letter"",""itemprop"":""image""}]",https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/dear-mother-and-father/,"<p><strong>Audio Clip</strong></p>
<p><strong>From:</strong> Library of Congress, Gifford Pinchot Papers<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Hotel Florence, Missoula, Mont.,<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> July 23, 1896</p>
<p>Dear Mother and Father,<br />
There has been a complete change of plan since I wrote you two days ago, or was it yesterday? The Commission has decided, wisely as I think, that I can be more useful by spending three weeks in the Bitter Root Mountains than by going to Alaska with John Muir. Of course the Alaska trip would be the most pleasant, but I hardly think it would do as much either to help the general cause, or to give me a knowledge of the forests. The plan is now as follows. On Monday, Harry &amp; I start from a place called Hamilton, 50 or 60 miles from here, with a pack train, &amp; cross the mountains. Lieut. Ahern of the 25th Infantry is going with us. It is most fortunate that he is, for I suppose it would be impossible to select a better companion for a mountain trip. As his Col. told me, he is past master in all that relates to mountain travel. He has done a great deal of exploring and from his great success is evidently a skillful and prudent woodsman. He is also an enthusiast about forestry, and has been instrumental in getting the agitation started for a great area which he first explored, &amp; which I believe will some day be reserved. So I am greatly delighted that I am to have his company. Beside all his other qualities he is a very pleasant companion.<br />
The region where we are going is one of the most interesting in the country. We shall cross the mountains about 60 miles south of Missoula &amp; 80 down the Clearwater, traveling westward, until we reach the neighborhood of the Nez Perce’s Indian Res., and then return through Elk City and the Nez Perce’s Pass in the Bitter Root Mts, reaching Missoula again in 20 or 25 days. Graves arrives here tomorrow and I suppose we shall start early Monday morning from Hamilton. We have the man recommended as the best in this region for head guide, the man he prefers of all he knows, he tells me, will probably go a second man, and Ahern will bring a man of his Company as cook. His men are all colored. So we shall be fitted out in the most beautiful state, and as to provisions, we are going to take five pack horses, not to mention that this country is famous for elk and trout. So I don’t think we could be much better fixed. It is a good bear country too, but mostly black &amp; brown. Also, as the berries are not yet ripe, we shall probably not get any bear.<br />
I am furnishing this, beginning with first part on the 24th. The party has just left for Spokane via the Coeur d’ Alene region. I shall miss certain things I would like to see by staying here, but expect to meet the Com. in Portland and see the Cascade Reserve, and all of California with them. So what I miss will be nothing compared to what I shall gain.<br />
This morning I shall spend getting my accounts in shape to transmit to Washington, but in the mean time I must ask for another deposit. This trip will cost about $500., and I shall have to pay for it when I come out of the mts. The Com. pays Harry’s expenses while in the mts.<br />
I am as well as possible, &amp; weigh 171, which is six pounds more than usual in the woods. If that wretched Sergeant had only made plans in advance, this would have been an ideal trip for Amos. But I can’t tell anything about my movements even a short time ahead, so far as the plans of the Commission are concerned. If Amos could join me here, or better in Portland, for he would not be alone there if I were a day or two late, &amp; I wouldn’t have to wait for him, I am sure we could get into the woods in Oregon and California, and have a delightful time.<br />
Please address letters to Missoula. I shall be back here en route to the coast as soon as I come out of the mts.<br />
With much love to you all,<br />
Your loving son,<br />
Gifford</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Melda Williams<br />
<strong>Interviewee</strong>: Elizabeth Wilson</p>
<p><strong>MW</strong>: These recordings of Nez Perce Indians singing their native songs were made on the Nez Perce Reservation by Melda Williams during the fall and spring semesters of 1966 and ’67 in connection with her thesis entitled “Historical Background and Musical Analysis of Thirty Selected Nez Perce Songs”. If background material was related by the singer or a friend of the singer at the time of recording it is given after each song. Additional information relating to the songs is included in the written thesis.</p>
<p><strong>MW</strong>: Song Number One, Wyakin Song Given By A Male Buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>EW</strong>: Singer singing in Nez Perce. My mother had a sister Walla Walla though her name was older than her and she used to always sing her Wyakin Song that she got over in Montana hunting. She was a little girl about 12. She went with a party to buffalo hunt and she got lost there for many days. She landed in Missoula with the Flathead Indians. She just got lost and this is where she got her guidance spirit, Wyakin, from male buffalo. Early in the morning when she got exhausted that’s when they said it was easier to get that Wyakin. So that’s when she got it. She saw the light coming from the east and then she just passed out and saw a vision that came. Light, first light, electric light, brighter than that. Then she saw a man’s head, an old handsome man talked to her. Girl, I’ve given you all the power. You never will need anything through your life. You won’t be progressive. And this is the song I’m giving you. This is the song we used to hear my mother sing this when we were little. She’d sing think of her sister and that’s the song my aunt used to sing when she grew up. Every winter they have those, you know, celebrations with medicine dance. She didn’t get up every evening to dance, no, she was kind of reserved and young cousins, men, would come and beg her. Cousin you want to sing so she would agree and she’d sing often every night, no, it was too much for her for some reason. Then she’d be kind of weak the rest of the week and it affected her some way.</p>
<p><strong>MW</strong>: Song Number Two, Wyakin Song Given By A Mountain Goat.</p>
<p><strong>EW</strong>: I’m going to sing another song that originates from the famous band of Hemasineapo. They had lots of guiding spirit songs and this one particular one I’ll sing it for you. Singer singing in Nez Perce. Then he’d send out a word. He’d tell the crowd it’s none other that presented this song to me. Not anywhere around here but over in the Craigs near Old Man Lake that’s where this originated from. It was presented to me by the wild mountain goat.</p>

Together with Bob Mutch and Bud Moore, Dave participated in fire studies, and in drafting the first wilderness fire policy that included naturally-occurring fires that were not suppressed, as well as studying the role fire plays in a pristine ecosystem.

Dave grew up in Missoula, Montana in a family that enjoyed outdoor recreation. After graduating from the University of Montana, with a degree in Forestry, Dave worked in Idaho and Montana managing timber resources, and also worked with the Fire School to manage forest fire in the National Forests. Since this training taught him only fire suppression, he experienced a change of thinking in order to accept the idea of allowing fire to burn in an ecosystem. For this reason, he became a natural spokesperson for teaching the public about the radical new policy.",Bob Mutch; Dave Aldrich; Fire Policy,https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/selway-podcast-ep29.mp3?_=6,Dave Aldrich 2011,https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dave-aldrich-2011.jpg,sbw311_img.jpg,"[{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/30th-white-cap-anniversary-2002.jpg"",""id"":""740"",""title"":""30th White Cap Anniversary,\u0026nbsp;2002"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""30th White Cap Anniversary, 2002"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/bud-moore-and-dave-bad-luck-lo-1973.jpg"",""id"":""744"",""title"":""Bud Moore and Dave, Bad Luck LO,\u0026nbsp;1973"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Bud Moore and Dave Aldrich, Bad Luck Lookout, 1973.

<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Dave Aldrich and Bob Mutch<br />
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Powell, Idaho<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> July 16, 2011</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Okay. Cool. So when you were here at Powell, for three years you were here at Powell?</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Actually five seasons.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Five seasons from, do you remember the year?</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Oh, yah, 1958, second week in June.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Reported to a little tent, 8 x 10 or 10 x 12 tent set on a platform out behind the Ranger Station here. At that time the BPR was surveying the road in to Powell. It was a two lane, it wasn’t a two lane, it was a two track road and they were surveying it and it was subsequently built and completed during the years I worked there.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah. So how much contact with the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness did you, or what eventually became the Selway-Bitterroot because it wasn’t even wilderness yet.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> It was the Selway Wilderness, I think, didn’t they call it?</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Primitive Area. Selway Primitive Area.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Yah, Primitive Area.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah. And the Bitterroot Primitive Area wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Yah. I think they were separate but anyway we were aware that it was there.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> I fought fire in it but basically there was no wilderness program. Powell Ranger District at that time was de facto wilderness for the most part. Had the Lolo motor trail, you know, that goes up and cuts across and then they had roads up Wendover, Papoose, I can’t say the name of the next one. Anyway, there were a few roads. They had the road to Elk Summit. I mean, it was a pretty wild area. The road down the highway, the highway down the river went as far as Wendover Campground which is about three-four miles down here and then it ended. I remember coming off a smoke chaser fire one time. Dick Ramberg took us up to the top and we went across the Lolo motor trail and clear up on the divide and dropped down into Post Office Creek and we had no radios at that time. The instructions were basically go put the fire out and when you get the fire put out walk down to the Lochsa Trail and then walk up the river and when you get to the end of the trail we’ll have a vehicle come up there and check along about quitting time every day and see if you’re there. So we bailed off the top of the hill with two canteens full of water and our six mules apiece and, you know, went down and did our fire thing and then we got finished we fought our way down to the Selway River and walked up and waiting and sure enough somebody came down and picked us up. That’s a fact. So, you know, probably sounds like a stupid way to use people but it was very, I felt very satisfied in it, you know. It was a walk in the woods, it was fighting a fire, and then go down and get to go back home and get cleaned up and I like the more broad things, what looks right. And, you know, our White Cap thing was the epitomy of that Bob for me and it was the first thing I’d ever seen like that.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> We had a one page document basically that told us that what they want us to do is go out and determine the planning procedures for allowing fire to play a natural role, more nearly natural role in the wilderness. A lot of strings, no constraints, except get it done in two years I think was our initial assignment.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> It left a lot to one’s creativity.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> And that’s the neat thing, you know. When you write down all the stuff you want them to do then you’d just as well go do the job for them, you know, you don’t have to think. Broad direction, you know, is good because it allows people to do what needs to be done. And I hesitate to think what would have happened if we’d have had a lot of specific direction on. It wouldn’t look like it does today, I know.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> And people start to write their own biases into the direction and you find doors shut that should be open at the beginning and we found, didn’t we, Dave, that the doors were open to take this in any avenue that made sense.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Absolutely. And that was probably, that was the most exciting time in my professional career when we had that. I didn’t understand why but we were given here’s what right looks like, this is what we want to have at the end of it, a guidebook on doing this kind of thing. And given our budget to go to talk to anybody we wanted to and do anything. And we got great support, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Yah.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> You know, well, we got Jim Habeck, you know, we had him on our contract. We got involved with the soils and the watershed people, the ecologist group, and Fisheries and Wildlife.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Doris Milner and the Montana Wilderness Association. We could go anywhere to anybody, Idaho Fish and Game and get their ideas.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uh-huh. So, you’re going to have to get back to, what year was this?</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Oh, I’m sorry. Okay, I jumped from 19.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> That’s okay. You can jump as long as I know what year you’re talking about right now.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> 1967. Okay. I did the timber thing until 1967.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> No, it was ’70. I’m sorry. I did it from ’67 to ’70.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uhm.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> And my boss came in one day to do my annual rating and he threw a flyer on my desk and he said you like fire you might want to take a look at this. And after he finished my evaluation I went ahead and read it and it was. The advertisement says we want somebody to come in and do the wilderness fire study and it was that one page thing I was talking about. And I went home and showed it to my wife and, you know, she said well, whatever you want to do, you know, that kind of thing. I said I want to do that so applied and I got accepted for it so that was a monumental thing that I had no idea about it, you know. It’s like walking in a door that you’d never seen before. When I opened the door there’s a brand new world out there.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, the flyer was to apply to Montana, to Bud Moore’s.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Region One.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Region One and who, and was it Bud Moore that you were applying to?</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> No, it didn’t. Indirectly. It was flown, advertised by the Bitterroot National Forest.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uhm.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> And Orville Daniels was the Forest Supervisor on the Forest at that time. Bob Graham was the fire person. And we were not directly assigned to the fire yet we were to be facilitated by the fire shop. And so Orville was our hole man. Orville was the person that we went to for a lot of conversation, guidance, to bounce things off of, and that sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So were you two the ones that were responsible for kind of setting the agenda?</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> And how did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Well, Dave was reading his one page in Idaho. There was a guy in Missoula, Montana, reading his one page same flyer and one day having his epiphany about oh, my God, this is the finest job I ever heard of. And so instead of hiring one they hired both of us. Didn’t they, Dave?</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> They did.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> They didn’t hire one but it was too, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> They did. The research, the fire lab basically paid your salary but we had the money in the White Cap program to… your travel and those kinds of things. But Bob can tell you more about those arrangements than I. But we had Bob, you know, 24-7 for three years.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So how did you, like how did you approach this assignment? What were some of the things that you set up for yourself to do that either succeeded or failed?</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Well, I guess, you know, the first thing when I went to apply I thought a little bit about it, you know, because I had a couple-three weeks before I had my interview.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> This was in 1970?</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Like May.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> And as I drove over from Elk River, Idaho, to Hamilton, Montana, for the interview I thought well, you know, we were into this preplanning, designating places where we were going to control fires and actually doing line construction ahead of it, you know, so that we had a place to anchor and fight fires. I see this big preplanning exercise going on in fire. Strictly mechanical control approach to it. And when I got the job and I met Bob Mutch the first day. He opened the window. I was looking at the world, it was like looking at a baseball game through a knothole and he put me in the stadium. He introduced me to some fire ecology and he gave me a lot of reading to do about fire that I had not an inkling of thought that existed. And so everything that I brought, all my preconceived things were in the air. And, you know, Bob and I were partners but Bob was the thought leader at that point. There is no question about it. He had resources that were totally unknown to me and I spent all the time I worked with him getting things from Bob, you know, out of journals and things and, but even more important my, what would you call it, academic world or whatever, my concepts were the hole in the fence looking to a baseball game.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Can you think of, can you remember any in particular that were like ah-hah moments for you? You mentioned fire ecology and that particularly changed your thinking?</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Well, yah. There were a bunch of ecologists, Bob would send abstracts down, and Kilgore did a lot of letter writing. Bud Heinselman had some stuff. Who was the guy at, that had the experimental burn we saw at Sequoia/King’s Canyon? The old gray haired doctor.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Oh, Bizwell.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Bizwell. Earl Bizwell. Bob started dropping ecological monographs on me that I read and they made sense. That was the scary thing, you know, but they were brand new world to me so my growth curve, learning curve, or whatever you want to call it was vertical for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> And we did. Bob set the Sequoia/King’s Canyon trip up and we went to there and got to listen to more ecological things but basically we got a flight, right.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> And on a flight we observed, saw, located I guess you’d say a fire that was burning in the Park and became one of their let burn fires. It turned out to be, I think, their largest fire that they had during the period of the programs they had down there.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> And, you know, I came back, I tell you what, boy, I was on steroids. I just never worried about it, you know, this kind of stuff. So, you know, in a period, a very short period, I’m talking about weeks, I went from well we’ll do this pre-attack planning and, you know, we can go out and burn it out or, you know, that kind of thing to one of here’s this thing called fire. It’s a part of the ecosystems out here and it had been for evolutionary time and the interactions between plants and things that are going on on the ground, that kind of thing. So, I tell you what, I was learning and learning fast and liking it.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Bob, we went, we came out to the White Cap area too. We took a trip very, very quickly after we got assigned to it, go out and look at the, get the lay of the land and<br />
a place where we could get away from telephones and people and that kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Oh, well, probably, you know, there were the expectations thing. We had a two year drop dead time limit on the program initially and, you know, I began to worry because I could see there was so much to assimilate.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Go ahead. You had a thought.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> No, no. All I was going to say is that, you know, I felt the same way. If you let yourself you could feel overwhelmed, couldn’t you.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Yah.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Because so many pieces to put together but yet we just two people instead of one and I thought it was a huge advantage, Dave, that you representing National Forest systems, the management side of the Forest Service, and I could represent the research side and knowledge and information and fire ecology. Bring those two together and I, for me it helped melt some of these huge expectations to something that was doable.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> And I think that’s right. I know that’s right. We would never have gone where we went had I had to do it myself. There’s no question about that. But we did go to Paradise Cabin.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> And then we went up to Cooper’s Flat and spent some time. Walked up on the mountain. I think we went up on the north slope there.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Well, what were you guys looking for when you did that first trip?</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> I think we were, I just had to get out of the cabin, had to get out and get in on the area and look at it a little bit. But it, it was just a very comfortable and easy way to have these dialogues about what we were looking at and what we might be seeing two years down the road. And that became one of the things that Bob kind of directed us and directed a lot of his work toward was understanding the fire history, the fire frequency in different ecosystems, things like that. But, you know, here’s this poor dumb forester who comes out with, you know, very mechanical looking at doing things and suddenly here are all these variables, interrelated variables that have to be put into some kind of a context in order to deal with them. And it was the greatest time of my life, you know. It was a time that I wouldn’t have traded for anything. But very changing in me too I think in terms of my personal life too. You know, the way I looked at things.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Well, can, in what way? Can you give me an example?</p>
<p><strong>DA:</strong> Well, it, yah, I was very, what would you call it, like going down a hallway and basically took the walls away and began to look at everything more broadly with more acceptance I think.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep29.mp3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Download Podcast</a></p>"

Later, as a Ranger, Bruce helped to educate users on minimal impact wilderness use, and reveals how the job honed his own wilderness ethic, and his approach to human interaction with pristine lands.

<p><strong>Interviewee</strong>: Bruce Farling<br />
<strong>Interviewer</strong>: Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: Missoula, Montana<br />
<strong>Date</strong>: April 14, 2011</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> What… you were Wilderness Ranger at Moose Creek from…</p>
<p><strong>BF:</strong> ’80 to ’88.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> ’80 to ’88. Okay, that’s quite a long time. What were your duties as a Wilderness Ranger back there?</p>
<p><strong>BF:</strong> Uhm, we had a whole array of things that we were kind of responsible for doing. For most of my time there, there were three of us; we sort of split the district up. At the time it was all wilderness, and so we split it up, and so we were sort of mini district rangers in some respects, and responsible for a particular part of the district. I was responsible for the western part. I worked out of an end-of-the road cabin at Lost Horse, which is actually in Montana, but up near the boundary. Our duties were administering outfitter permits, some trail maintenance, fire monitoring, wildfire monitoring, law enforcement, picking up trash, educating the public about being as much as possible, sort of low-trace, minimal trace users of wilderness. Then, we’d occasionally get projects that… it was one of the interesting things about the job. It had so much variety. We had a project that the Forest, or the region needed to do, a research project. One year, Warren and I were involved, and we had to run a project, to sample high lakes for acid rain changes. What we did was, we were trained up to collect water sampled, but, it was an EPA project, in partnership with the Forest Service wherein… we spent about a month or so on this, where the EPA showed, for a project of this sort of scientific rigor, they randomly picked lakes, and some of these lakes were just a bear to get to. It required some people who kind of knew how to get back in that kind of country, because we had to haul boats in, and we had to haul in all this sampling equipment, and all this sort of stuff. So, we got involved because we had the skills that sort of stuff. Then, we did the sampling, because we knew how to use pack stock, and we could… some of these lakes you couldn’t get pack stock to. We’d get them as far as we could, and then we’d backpack all the gear and the boats. We did stuff like we hired… did it in early fall after the lakes had turned over… we hired some jumpers on detail, because we figured what’s the next best thing to having a mule to get to that lake, and we hired some jumpers. Those guys loved it. They didn’t have anything else to do. So, we would occasionally get projects like that. There were some fish projects that I did, that were inventorying fish barriers on streams for the… where there were log jams that may have blocked anadromous fish. I did that… a Forest Fisheries Biologist that I know; he’s in Missoula; he’s a friend… at the time would get some extra money from BPA to de these anadromous fish restoration projects. I did a little bit of survey stuff where I actually got to go do some hook-and-line sampling, which I loved, to find out what was in some lakes that nobody had really done any sort of ling in them, to see… Idaho Fish and Game had put some particular trout species in there earlier, and nobody had gone back to see…</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Do you remember what lakes those were?</p>
<p><strong>BF:</strong> Uhm, there were some of the ones on the western part of the district, or the eastern part of the district, so it would have been like, oh hell, some of the ones above Bear Creek. Diamond lake, Mo Lake, Spruce Lake, I can’t remember some of the other ones. They also… there was also a crew that did the same thing too, a seasonal crew that worked a couple of years, I remember. So, basically, you know, we had these general duties, which were an array of things, and then, we also had these occasional projects that would float in from some other folks on the Forest. We did range work.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>BF:</strong> Basically, we sort of initiated…Dick Walker was very influential in setting this up when Dick was in there. We monitored range trend. We had recreational grazing permits, that the outfitters had, and we had to sort of determine when there was too much pressure…</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, what does that mean, exactly, “Too much pressure?”</p>
<p><strong>BF:</strong> Too many horses and mules on a particular pasture in the fall, that outfitters were using, and we don’t want them to grind it into dirt.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, when you decide that there is too much pressure in a camp site or a grazing site, what steps do you take, and were there any incidents where you actually have to confront people?</p>
<p><strong>BF:</strong> No, generally… the general schtick was to… First of all, we’d try to contact as many visitors as we could. That was a very large part of our job. We’d try to steer them away from certain places voluntarily, and say, you know, don’t go here, if you don’t mind not camping in this area, because we’re trying to let it grow back, because it’s just gotten pounded. We’d do that. There were some instances where there were some places that were actually closed to camping. Some places over in the Crags, on the west side of the district, Cove Lakes, for example, was a particularly tough place to get people to reduce the pressure on. It got beat up pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, the thinking behind that is that if you steer people away, the wilderness will kind of reclaim the land and it keeps it more pure, or…?</p>
<p><strong>BF:</strong> Mmm-hmmm. We were pretty… I gotta admit, I really did sort of hone my wilderness ethic back there. I hadn’t really thought about a lot of this stuff, but our job was to… our primary job as wilderness rangers (it was the district’s deal), was to… and the ethic that ran through that place for a long, long time, was to reduce the impact of human beings as much as possible in there. Not saying human beings couldn’t use it, but work with people and educate them to use it in a fashion with as little disturbance as possible.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> I’ve heard some people say that because it was an all-wilderness district for many years, that that district actually set the standard for wilderness management for the entire country. Do you… what’s your opinion about that, and can you give me any examples?</p>
<p><strong>BF:</strong> We used to think we did. I don’t know if we did or not. I don’t know, I do think that we were leaders, absolutely… We were leaders in a couple of ways in terms of some of the education approaches on minimum impact use of wilderness, and also, I know we were definitely leaders in continuing use of so-called primitive skills. That is the use of crosscut saws, the use of an axe, minimum impact trail maintenance and construction, and a lot of the skills that I learned in there… you know, I still… I don’t use them very much, but I learned how to swing an axe in there. I still go out and go hiking, and I always look at how the trail crews, no matter where I am, how they cut a log. I can always tell when they didn’t have any training. It looks like a beaver was gnawing, or something, you know? I mean, we pride ourselves in that stuff, and actually, trail crews… seasonal trail crews over the years were competitive about it.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, what is the benefit to wilderness to having primitive skills and using them over, say, chainsaws, and four-wheeler ATVs…?</p>
<p><strong>BF:</strong> Well, in designated wilderness, you can’t use that stuff, unless there’s some special exception for some special circumstances, which were always a battle. But there’s less of an opportunity for the Forest Service or the BLM or the Parks Service, when they’re managing designated wilderness, to slip, and say, oh, you know, that’s going to be too hard, we’ve got to use chain saws, if you’ve got a cadre of people who know how to use these other tools right. We prided ourselves on that stuff. We’d have a big jackstraw of logs, you know, that blew down just stacked up on one another, and a lot of folks in the Forest Service would go, God, we really need to get a chain saw in there. We’d go, no, you don’t, because we’ve got sharp saws, and we know how to use them. These were skills that are hundreds of years old, and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, it’s preserving sort of a folk art, or a skill?</p>
<p><strong>BF:</strong> Yeah, it’s sort of a folk art, but it’s more than art. It’s a pragmatic approach to doing work, and doing it in a way that is consistent with wilderness, you know? No mechanized advantages. That was very cool, I mean, I still remember how to do that stuff. And we used pack stock. Not too much, but we used… We also prided ourselves on a lot of Forest Service wilderness management was really pack-stock oriented. We used pack stock, but we were also backpack oriented. We used backpack trail crews, which was kind of unusual. Not totally unusual, but unusual enough…. You know they went out on ten-day hitches. Ten days’ worth of food and a crosscut saw, and a Pulaski or an axe or something on their back, with 80-pound packs, very uncommon. It’s uncommon today; it was uncommon back then in the Forest Service. Most of them were pack stock supported trail crews. But these guys were quick. Hit and run. Our trail crews and wilderness rangers did the same thing. You’d have to bring, you know… deal with all the expense and fooferah dealing with pack stock.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep28.mp3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Download Podcast</a></p>

sbw309,Wild Wolf Howl,"August 20, 2012",2012-08-20,Episode 27,sbw309.mp3,10:05,"In this episode, titled “Wild Wolf Howl,” we hear from Dave Campbell, who serves as the Wilderness Ranger at the West Fork Ranger District. [Correction: Dave is the District Ranger responsible for Wilderness.]

Dave grew up in Colorado with a family that enjoyed the out-of-doors. He tells the story of a family backpack trip into the Raywah Wilderness in Colorado when he was a child, and a wilderness ranger came into the camp with a mule, a little burro. As Dave tells it, he was astonished that someone actually got paid to do that. At that point, Dave knew what he wanted to do, and he pursued a career in the outdoors, first at Colorado State with a major in wildlife, and then ending up in Forestry and Recreation. He first worked in planning, became certified as a Siviculturist, and later worked in the Line Officer position as a Ranger, first as an Acting Ranger on the Okanogan in Washington, where he dealt with his first wilderness issues. He moved to the Anaconda-Pintler where he served as a Ranger and began work on organizing a Wilderness Center of Excellence at the West Fork Ranger district. In 1997, Dave moved to the ranger position at West Fork, where he currently serves.

Dave discussed administrative problems in a wilderness that crosses the Idaho-Montana state line, the inspiration he drew from Aldo Leopold’s <em>A Sand County Almanac</em>, and his determination to protect the pristine Selway River. Here, he discusses the reintroduction of the Gray Wolves from Canada into the wilderness, and the controversy surrounding them.",Dave Campbell; Wildlife,https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/selway-podcast-ep27.mp3?_=8,Dave Campbell at the West Fork Ranger Station 2011,https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/dave-campbell-at-the-west-fork-ranger-station-2011.jpg,sbw309_img.jpg,"[{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/dave-campbell-at-the-west-fork-ranger-station-2011.jpg"",""id"":""686"",""title"":""dave campbell at the west fork ranger station\u0026nbsp;2011"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Dave Campbell at the West Fork Ranger Station 2011"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/dave-campbell-at-west-fork-ranger-station-2011.jpg"",""id"":""687"",""title"":""dave campbell at west fork ranger station\u0026nbsp;2011"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Dave Campbell at West Fork Ranger Station 2011"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/dave-campbell-talking-with-an-outfitter-at-the-ranger-station.jpg"",""id"":""688"",""title"":""dave campbell talking with an outfitter at the ranger\u0026nbsp;station"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Dave Campbell talking with an outfitter at the ranger station"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/trappers-peak-near-dave-campbells-ranger-station.jpg"",""id"":""689"",""title"":""trapper\u0026#8217;s peak near dave campbell\u0026#8217;s ranger\u0026nbsp;station"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Trapper\u0026#8217;s Peak near Dave Campbell\u0026#8217;s ranger station"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/4514858142_cdf0775aea_o.jpg"",""id"":""691"",""title"":""4514858142_cdf0775aea_o"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Gray wolf"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/gray-wolf-walking-in-snow.jpg"",""id"":""692"",""title"":""Gray-wolf-walking-in-snow"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Gray wolf walking in snow"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/dave-campbell.jpg"",""id"":""701"",""title"":""dave campbell"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Celebrating 40th Anniversary of free-burning fires in Selway Country: Bob Mutch, Ranger Dave Campbell, author Steve Pyne, following an overflight of the wilderness."",""itemprop"":""image""}]",https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/wild-wolf-howl/,"<p><strong>Audio Clip</strong></p>

<strong>Location</strong>: West Fork Ranger Station, south of Darby, Montana,<br />
<strong>Date</strong>: April 18, 2011</p>
<p><strong>DC:</strong> Wolf reintroduction of course is hugely controversial in this part of the world.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Would you mind talking a little bit about the reintroduction of wolves and how it came about and what the controversy is right now?</p>
<p><strong>DC:</strong> Sure. I&#8217;m by no means the expert.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>DC:</strong> I&#8217;ve been&#8230; since it is a Fish and Wildlife Service action, we’re cooperating with&#8230; luckily, we&#8217;re not, we, the Forest Service aren&#8217;t in the driver&#8217;s seat, but it was in&#8230; trying to think, it was in &#8217;95 I think when the decision was made to reintroduce wolves in the Yellowstone and central Idaho. So, they did&#8230; and those&#8230; my feeling is they’ve been wildly successful. Wolves produce much better than Grizzly bears. They have litters, not a pair; they have a really high reproductive rate, and so they have done very well, both in the central Idaho release and in the Yellowstone release. I&#8217;ve been fascinated to watch the relationship of people to this iconic figure, if you will, in wilderness. The pin from the 30th anniversary of the Wilderness Act has a howling wolf with a moon. I wore this pin a lot, and some people say I&#8217;m trying to generate controversy. No, I just like the pin, and what it signifies. I mean there&#8217;s a lot of symbolism behind wolves, going back to Aldo Leopold and his “Thinking Like a Mountain.” So anyway, very successful, and its caused a lot of tension as anybody that&#8217;s been around and not buried their head in the sand. Just this week, Congress undertook for the first time, I believe the papers said, and I think it&#8217;s probably true, to legislatively remove a species from the Endangered Species Act through an act of Congress in Idaho/Montana with Mike Simpson in Idaho and John Tester in Montana trying to remove it. They said okay, we&#8217;re going to settle this question on wolves in Idaho and Montana. Of course, Wyoming is still their own special case, but it&#8217;s really, what&#8217;s interesting to me about this, and what&#8217;s fascinating about wilderness management is it&#8217;s a lot about people&#8217;s perceptions, perspectives, people’s perceptions about what wilderness is or ought to be, what they think it is, and what they hold dear, in the wilderness, whatever it is. Wolves are a perfect symbol of that, because guess what? They do eat elk, and so, they&#8217;re your competitor. We’re competing predators. They do howl and that is a very wild sound. You hear that, and it&#8217;s like in Northern Minnesota they say the song of the loon is the crazy wild sound. I think that&#8217;s true here. It&#8217;s&#8230; If you&#8217;re way back in the woods and hearing a wolf howl, it&#8217;s like being in Africa and hearing a lion roar in the distance. It&#8217;s an iconic kind of thing, and I think it&#8217;s separated people into these camps, although there is some overlap and many, many people think they&#8217;re back to before&#8230; they&#8217;re not “thinking like a mountain,” they&#8217;re thinking we got to get rid of the wolves because we want more elk. Instead of thinking in the holistic, functioning ecosystem kind of approach, which I kind of prefer, personally, and wolves are part of the system. It&#8217;s an incomplete system without them. Sure, we can have lots of debates about how many, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to make sense to call this a complete and functioning system when you&#8217;ve removed some of the keystone pieces of it. That&#8217;s a challenge in wilderness. The other challenge is the outside influences, you know, acid rain in some wildernesses is a big issue, and in the Selway, our biggest issue is invasive plants, noxious weeds. The wolf issue really is almost a sociological study as well as a biological one. It&#8217;s pretty hard not to say wolves are recovered&#8230; personally, I don&#8217;t think wolves will ever be gone unless they go back to poisoning and trapping. I really would be surprised to see that happen.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Now, did they used to do that?</p>
<p><strong>DC:</strong> Oh yeah, that&#8217;s the only way, I think, that wolves were eliminated from the West was by a combination of everything: wolf pelts, cyanide, pellets and I can&#8217;t remember what kind of poisoning, but they used everything available to kill every wolf on sight. It was the only way that they ever got rid of them. I don&#8217;t see society having that tolerance for that kind of level of eradication. So they&#8217;ll be here. That&#8217;s caused complications when you start to talk about other charismatic megafauna, like grizzly bears. Nobody in their right mind, politically, is going to come in and say well, now that we&#8217;ve succeeded with wolves, we&#8217;re going to talk about grizzly bears. Not right now! So bears will probably show up on their own, and we&#8217;ll deal with them under the full protection of the ESA when they do. That will be another interesting wilderness challenge. I think that because it does&#8230; the wonderful thing about managing in wilderness, one of the things for managers is, it does afford a manager with more of an idealistic&#8230; you can operate on your ideals a little more than you might in forest management or range management. The Wilderness Act is not like most other acts. There&#8217;s a lot more poetry, a lot more value and emotion in it than others. So it&#8217;s a privilege. You have two huge wildernesses here and you&#8217;re part of both of them.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep27.mp3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Download Podcast</a></p>

It was while he was working there that he and his family took a trip through the Bitterroot Valley, and he saw Trapper Peak for the first time. As Orville put it, “I said this is where I want to be, I want to work here, I want to work here. And it was just an instant reaction to how beautiful Trapper Peak is and mountains. As originally a kid from Kansas those mountains were really very special.” He transferred to the Job Corps program, and eventually landed a position as a supervisor for the Lolo National Forest, later transferring to the Bitterroot National Forest where he would serve for twenty years. During his time there, Orville would be part of the group responsible for implementing the wilderness fire policy, and for originating the “one launch per day” floating policy on the Selway River. Here, he talks about one of the famous early fires that tested the new fire policy, and the subsequent controversy surrounding it.",Fire Policy; Orville Daniels,https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/selway-podcast-ep26.mp3?_=9,"Orville Daniels, 2011",https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/orville-daniels-portrait.jpg,sbw308_img.jpg,"[{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/1st-pnf-bad-luck-fire-8-19-72-5.jpg"",""id"":""673"",""title"":""1st-PNF-Bad-Luck-Fire-8-19-72-5"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""1st Prescribed Naturally-occurring Fire on Bad Luck Creek 8-19-72.

<strong>Location</strong>: Missoula, Montana<br />
<strong>Date</strong>: April 15, 2011</p>
<p><strong>OD:</strong> So, anyway, we had that team going and the next critical part of it was to sell the program to the Chief of the Forest Service because what we wanted was that this be an official program sanctioned by the Chief so that it could be replicated elsewhere and so forth and quite frankly you could not do wilderness fire management without Chief’s approval. So, we took the program back to the Washington office. Once we had thrashed it out and decided what the prescriptions would be and where the prescriptions were applied on the ground we flew back, Bob Mutch and I, to sell the program. And selling is the right word, and we went to the Chief of staff and, you know, there are a lot of memories with that. We went to the Congressional offices and talked to them. We did a whole bunch of preparing the soil for people to accept this concept. And I’ll never forget the most telling personal account that occurred during that and we were, we were, we were presenting it to the Chief of Staff and I believe his name was Buckum, he was the Associate Chief for Research, and he said we need to get behind this program and he said because of all of those big old yellow-bellied ponderosa pine that need to be preserved we need to get behind this program because fire management will keep those going and so forth and so forth. McIntyre, I’m trying to get the Chief’s name at that time, McGuire, John McGuire. John McGuire was also a researcher who came into the research but John was a really great Chief. I would put him at that time as being the best of the modern chiefs. He really, really understood and his comment was he said well, you know, you’re right about those trees but that’s not the purpose here. The purpose here is to maintain the ecosystem mechanisms, not develop yellow-bellied pine. And I thought yaaaaah we got it. I mean that was so, to hear the Chief of the Forest Service put it so succinctly that we needed fire for the ecological purposes of fire in the wilderness that you knew you were going to make it. And we got approval and it wasn’t long after that that we had our first fire in the wilderness, a little one that didn’t amount to much, which would have been the first fire with Chief of Forest Service sanction in the Nation.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> That was the Bad Luck Fire?</p>
<p><strong>OD:</strong> No, the first one was a little one that burned up on a hillside. It was a lightning strike and it was only two and a half acres and it went out by itself. Then the second one was the Bad Luck Fire and that one is just rife with personal experiences and things that happened.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Can you talk about a couple of those that seem very vivid to you?</p>
<p><strong>OD:</strong> Sure, I’d be happy to. Oh, yah, there’s some real vivid memories there. I was in Missoula at a meeting when the Bad Luck Fire started and they called me, they called me on the phone, we got a fire, we got a fire. And I tell them I got to leave the meeting and go down to Hamilton and, of course, at that point whether to apply the prescription or not fell to our supervisor, I mean only the forest supervisor could make the decision. And I wasn’t about to make the decision sitting in a meeting so we went down and the group briefed me on where it was and so forth and whether it would fit in and we said yes and so we allowed it to start burning. And it burned for 42 days as I recall. It was a fascinating experience. Now, I mentioned that I had, how I got to the job, but I didn’t mention that I was, fire was, you know, and I say I don’t know where I got this idea of fire use, fire suppression and fire was something I had been doing. I was a fire, what they called the fire control staff at that time on the Challis National Forest for a couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>OD:</strong> And that’s, that’s in the Middle Fork country in what’s now the Frank Church Wilderness and so I had some feeling there but I was a fire person. I had started when I was in the Bridger National Forest as a person who, you know, went out as an assistant ranger when we fought fire and I wasn’t in what I call the fire fraternity but I was active in fire management and the leadership of the Forest Service was kind of pushing me towards that as part of my career interests. And so I knew that I wanted to make that decision based on the information and make it carefully but then when I got, so soon as it was going I didn’t go over there immediately but the first weekend that came along I took my two boys and we went over and we walked the fire, we could from Paradise you could walk the fire.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> What does it mean to walk the fire?</p>
<p><strong>OD:</strong> Just get out and walk through it. And I was carrying a, I was carrying a shovel which every good fire fighter carries a shovel when they’re on the fire line and it was like, the personal recollection is really strong, standing on a hillside and there’s a burning log and my inclination is as a fire control person was to turn that log so it wouldn’t roll down the hill, you know, turn that log and then I thought no that’s not what we’re doing. It’s a paradigm change. I mean the agency, even though I had a commitment, there’s still the old habits. And the whole agency had that, the old habit. It was a slow transition. Even when it’s logical, even when your brain says this is what we’re doing, you know, habits and emotion carry and so it was like I’d want to stop those rolling pine cones from burning and rolling down the hill and I’d want to turn the log. And I had to resist my own impulses of suppression. And finally after about an hour and a half of walking through the fire with my sons we were, oh, I think probably around 10 and 8 at the time, they could keep up and the fire was burning benignly and you could see it creep along and then take out a little patch of Douglas fir and you say yah that’s one of the things that we wanted to do and blah, blah, blah. And so it was just a revelation to be out there. Everything up until then had been an intellectual game. At that point, I mean you’ve been on the fire and you really watched it and you begin to think of it in ecological terms, even though I was prepared for it but to set there, and so finally I would just set and watch it. And you could see how it was varying its pattern of burning and how intense it would be here, wouldn’t be over there, then this big conflagration. And see always before in the agency and even with me with my feelings for fire you always feared it. When you went on a fire you did not observe the fire, you put it out. I mean you were there to put that fire out and so you never stopped to really look at it, to really watch what it was doing. And now you might in a prescribed burn like I had seen but when it’s a wild fire it’s just like your head clicks and so the reality is I don’t think hardly any people in the Forest Service that were in the fire game had ever just sat and watched a fire burn very much. It just wasn’t what they were doing. And that’s why this little technician burning that I watched was so unusual because he was using it for a prescription and not very many people were really there, some but mostly they were using fire to burn slash and do those things. And he was using it in a, so it’s sort of like a bigger microcosm of the change the agency had to do. I had to do it.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Did you realize at the time how much of an impact what you were doing would have on the, on fire policy for the whole country or is that something you realized looking back or a little bit remote?</p>
<p><strong>OD:</strong> Looking back, you know, looking back because you, I don’t know, when you’re pioneering something you don’t really think in that way of well I’m making a difference in the country. What you really do is I want to do this because I think it’s right and you focus on that instead of the broad policy implications. I didn’t have enough maturity and, you know, when I was 50-60 I might have looked at it and said hey we’re changing the whole view but at the time no. And that’s a fascinating thing that you raise. It’s one of the things I’ve learned over my career is that if we are on the cutting edge you normally are not doing it to try to influence the whole world. You’re doing it to make that part of the world that you’re in whole. You’re trying to do the right thing as you see it and often, and it’s a fallacy of youth, you don’t understand what you’re setting in motion. Old hands sometimes will say oh, no, you start that and a lot of the old time fire guys were saying, nah this fire use is bad. It’ll teach people bad habits, we won’t put out fires, and there was a tremendous resistance within the fire community. Without Bud Moore’s leadership in the Regional Office I don’t think we could have ever gotten this done and on the Bad Luck Fire was typical. Now, the Bad Luck Fire there were some instances there I’d like to talk about but one of them, the major one was the fire got outside the fire management boundary and it’s a fact that has been well documented and so forth. And it crossed the river, the drainage, and started on the other side of the drainage. Well, by rights you’d put all the fire out but this is our first fire. It was our chance to do it and so I made an executive decision which was probably wouldn’t have stood the test of legality that were going to have two fires. We were going to have fire on the north, on the south side of the drainage which we were going to suppress and a fire on the north side which we were going to allow to continue to burn. And we really needed that fire on the north side. So it was sort of like cutting and fitting the situation. We’d never really thought about that in total depth so we called in the incident command team and that incident command team was just furious that we wouldn’t let them put the fire out. And I can’t remember that fellow’s name, it’ll come to me, but he was an old time fire fighter and he thought we were totally crazy and that we shouldn’t do that. Let me put that fire out. And, no, without Bud’s blessing I couldn’t have pulled it off. Even though I made the decision he supported it and later on the policy was that if it gets out of control the whole thing was out of control and you got to put it out or do something to it or we’ve got new terminology and new strategies, we’ve learned so much since then. When the fire was burning I just had to be out there. The other things went aside. And then after the fire within just I think it was five days after the fire had gone out by itself Bob Mutch and I went out and we walked the fire. And this fire became a very personal fire.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> The Bad Luck Fire?</p>
<p><strong>OD:</strong> The Bad Luck Fire, the Bad Luck Fire. And it was beginning to sprout green, grass was coming up, little forbs popping up, and you saw it as something of renewal, not something of destruction. And it had burned in a nice mosaic. It had burned out some dense stands of Douglas fir, left all the, pretty much all the big pine, and it had done what we wanted. And when we watched it we’d go out there and for two or three days it wouldn’t even, it would just smolder and then you’d get the right conditions and you’d get a little bit of a burn for a day or two days and you could see the varying intensities of fire. And that’s one thing that it demonstrated that most of us had never seen because when you go out to suppress a fire it’s usually in a very active burning stage and all you see is pretty uniform black and a running fire but when you’ve got a fire burning under the natural conditions it creeps, it burns a little here, it doesn’t burn there, etc., etc. if it’s in the right conditions, if it’s under prescription. So it was very, Bob and I walked that and then we went back the next spring and by the next spring when the snow went off I mean it was a carpet of grand flowers and things coming back and you knew. And so the result of that for, I don’t know, maybe 10 or 15 years, I’d be on a speaking circuit talking about the value of wilderness fire. And by then we fully knew what it meant from a systems standpoint within a very short time. It was clear it was going to change the agency. And although we weren’t thinking as much about that at the beginning it became clear very quickly. And it was almost like a religious experience to experience that fire. It gives you a passion for it, when you’ve done that you’ve invested so much in the study, so much in convincing people to do it that it really does become almost an ideology.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep26.mp3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Download Podcast</a></p>"

<p><strong>Interviewee</strong>: Josh Dolezal<br />
<strong>Interviewer</strong>: Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: Missoula, Montana<br />
<strong>Date</strong>: October 7, 2011</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, I’m really interested in the writing that you’ve done about the Selway-Bitterroot and I kind of put you in the same category as Norman McLain, you know, in terms of really capturing what that place is. So I’m going to get you to talk a little bit first about your essay “Selway by Headlamp” which was published in creative non-fiction.</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> In <em>Fourth Genre</em>.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> <em>Fourth Genre</em>, right. And so do you want to talk about how that essay, maybe just talk about the content of it and then how that essay came about.</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> That was the second essay that I wrote about the Selway. The other is called “The Sense Mill” and it came out in ISLE which is the journal for Interdisciplinary Studies of Literature and Environment. And “The Sense Mill” was about my first season hiking in to the Moose Creek cabin when I decided I was going to surprise the crew boss by hiking in in one day and he told us, you know, stay overnight at Three Links which is half way, 13 miles. And it was hot and we got up early and started hiking in the dark and we’re making good time. I just forgot to drink. I was in good condition but I just didn’t drink enough water and I got heat cramps and passed out actually at a certain point and so “The Sense Mill” is about, it wasn’t necessarily a near death experience but when you get to the point where you’re passing out and you’ve got full body cramps, I mean it could go either way essentially. You’ve extended your body far enough and so I was sort of meditating on the intensity of that experience, what I learned about, what I thought I learned about near death from that. And “Selway by Headlamp” sort of picked up with that theme because it was the next summer I hiked out to go to a conference and hiked out in one day and learned my lesson about how to hydrate. It was no problem really to hike the distance, it’s a fairly flat river trail, and so it wasn’t that hard, it was just a matter of drinking often enough and so I hiked out, flew to my conference, flew back, and in the airport on my way home I had talked to my sister, she was going through a divorce, I was distraught about this, and realized that I couldn’t probably sleep that night and I just decided to hike all the way in in the dark. And so, I don’t need to summarize the whole essay but it was a sort of braided narrative with, you know, concerns in the present and all of the milestones along the way to the trail giving me a sense of these were things that I had experienced in daylight and I was experiencing them in a new way in the darkness which was much like this experience my sister was going through in her divorce and ripples in the family and friends and all that. So in that sense I think the Selway gave me a chance to reflect on identity, on family, it was about more than just the wilderness experience. There was a lot, it was a touchstone for my life in other ways.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> And do you think the fact of walking, you know, one foot in front of the other on a river trail, is there something about the pace of walking a wilderness trail and the pace of thought. Do those things go together for you?</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> I think walking is very meditative. I often fall into a kind of trance when I walk. There’s a different rhythm to that than running or cycling. For cycling you’ve got to pay attention to all kinds of things you don’t have to if you’re walking if you’re in good shape and you’re not out of breath or, you know, in pain or something. Walking is a fairly relaxing way of engaging with landscape and so, yah, I spent a lot of time thinking on the trail. I wrote, it was the second summer, so 2002, I spent most of the summer writing poems. I wrote apparently 120 poems and tried to distill them into a manuscript and so every day on the trail I was watching for things, for images that I wanted to share with others. I often had these thoughts of wanting to share what was happening with friends and because I was so remote for so long, for three months, I wrote lots of letters, you know, every 10 days I would get my stack of mail from the mule packer when he brought in the groceries so I was in touch with people that way but I felt fairly cut off from friends and because it was such a special experience I had a profound urge to share that and so poetry was one way I tried to do that. And often I was trying to reassemble kind of the raw material of what I was seeing so that it would culminate in a kind of, I don’t want to use the word epiphany necessarily, but I wanted there to be some kind of discovery in the poem, I wanted it to kind of detonate in the last line for the reader so that there was a sense of that intensity.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So can you give an example or two?</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> Well, one very short poem that I can quote that, it’s probably better read because it’s so short and harder to probably follow, it’s called “Geometric” and I can just explain the basic idea. I was thinking about the Pythagorean Theorem randomly one day and thinking about the idea of feeling connected to landscape. I think I was reading Mary Blew’s “Bone Deep in Landscape” at the time and so this idea of the human being connected to the earth and I was thinking of the human being the vertical leg of the triangle and the earth being the horizontal leg and the view or sight connecting the two. And so the poem is called “Geometric” and it goes “Glacial basin scraped clean of all but grass, scattered birds, view so plain it could be the square root of the sum of this body, this earth.” So I don’t know if that needs for the reader in quite the way that it did for me but I was trying to reassemble a thought process and a kind of connection and an image that would share that experience.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, are there a couple of places in that landscape from where you had that experience like maybe up at Wylies or where you had that experience of looking down and?</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> Well, I wrote that poem I think on Freeman Peak, I didn’t write it on the peak but it was about that trail going out to, what is that lake, past Freeman Peak, I’ve forgotten. It’s not Horse Lake. I’d have to look at a map to remember the lake. I only went all the way out to the lake once because there was so much work to do in that trail. There was one time that we did a hitch part way and then came back but it was about the ridge line up there which was so spared and I was just thinking of, you know, the alpine country is so simplified in some ways, it was kind of like that square root idea.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So you guys did that trail or was that just a trip that you did, did you clear that trail?</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> We did some erosion control and that, you know. I don’t think that was one of the brushy trails. The Big Rock trail was brushy and just difficult. We never fully got that one done. But we had several loops that we did. The one that we did probably the most often was up Grizzly Saddle, across Moose Ridge, and then down through Ditch Creek and back up. We went always up Bailey Mountain and sometimes we went different ways. We did a lot of brushing on Bailey Mountain the first summer. So sometimes we’d go up that way and then down past Isaac Lake and back to Moose Creek. I know another time we went up Moose Creek and camped at the trail junction and worked up towards Someday Johnson Creek because there’d been a serious burn there and lots of cedar had fallen and that was quite a job.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So you were telling me about your poetry manuscript, that you were interested in addressing a different kind of wilderness experience. Can you talk about that?</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> I think a lot of times wilderness is perceived as a sort of bourgeois concept, you kow, that it’s a place where people recreate, where people go to bliss out, and you know have these mountaintop experiences but as a seasonal worker had a very different view of it because I was, I enjoyed very much working, feeling that I was caring in some way, stewarding in some way the land and not just doing a frivolous, not that recreation’s always frivolous but it wasn’t just about escaping from things. I felt kind of connected to the history of the land in a more profound way perhaps. And also torn at times between, one of the reasons I wanted to do wilderness trails is I had completely lost faith in the fire suppression policy of the Forest Service because I realized we never fought to defend the trailer court, you know, we fought to defend trophy homes that had been built in places that they shouldn’t have been built. We fought to protect timber resource that was meant to be harvested. A lot of the fires we shouldn’t have suppressed, we should have allowed them to burn because they were, you know, meant to burn off some of the downfall, especially in the lodgepole stands. I remember walking through 10 foot deep jackpots of lodgepole blow down and, you know, when that burns it can sterilize the soil or seriously delays the regenerative process that fire should serve. So I was disillusioned with that and I suppose I thought of trail maintenance as a more straight forwardly ethical way of caring for the land but, you know, we were clearing trails for outfitters that were bringing in bear hunters and I felt torn about that. Sometimes I wished I could just let the trail die, you know, let the trail.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Rewild itself.</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> Overgrown.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah, right.</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> I have actually a poem about that. So this is a poem titled “Mean” and it was published in the Hudson Review. “Cutting brush along a mountain tail, he fights two willful extremes, one desperate to trim back the whole hillside, shearing the banks straight up to the peak, the other longing to let the trail die, overgrow, smoothing the crease in the gray mountains brown. How fragile the middle space where he clears a footpath for a time, this labor worth most to himself, each sweep of an arm purging dust from his blood and the hearth at his core, clean enough for a household of one.” This is another one called “June Dream”. It rained every June that I worked out there and so this is about some of that and recalls some of the work that I did on the fire crew. “Low 40s, overcast, and wet. Rain drums on the shingles of an old guard station as day breaks without dawn. The muted trumpet of sky and the crews hard leather heels thump the frets of the trail. At the end of the day I stoke the cast iron stove, propping my boots along the edge to dry, rubbing what mink oil and wax I can into the seams in the toes. We spread our mummy bags on old canvas cots and I closed the chimney vent as the gas lantern sputters out. In the dark I’m left with the smell of wood smoke, the hint of mold in our clothes, and the glow of my own heat deep in the bag. Tonight I dream of a caravan of green pickups winding home just before dawn. The longest shift of my first year in a crew. We were done burning logging units for the tree planters, prewetting the edges with two inch hose, then lighting strips across the hill with drip torches. A job for late spring when rain and snow temper the burn. I was driving a club cab, third truck from the rear, my eyes singed with fatigue. Three young men slept in the back seat draped over each other like jeans in a heap and my crew boss slumped against the door in the front, his face buried in a fleece. Hannah, the other rookie on the crew sat next to me, the red lights on the dash mirrored in her eyes. I could smell her skin lotion and the wood smoke. My gaze locked on the tail lights of the truck ahead as my palm crept down the shift to her knee. As we turned a snore from the back made me slip my hand high up on the wheel, cinching my grip. In my dream she nestles against my shoulder as we take on the shape of two ridge lines, the silhouettes of our heads like twin peaks beneath a knuckled moon.” And then I’ll just read one more. This is the title poem of the manuscript. And this was toward the end of the summer. I remember seeing Someday Johnson Creek which was at that time a fresh burn so I think it had burned the year previously or two years prior to our visit and I remember just walking through this moonscape on the top of the ridge and seeing this little ribbon of green that came down through the middle of that and it was a series of very gentle pools and you could just, you know, it wasn’t a hot spring but you could just sit in a pool and have a bath and it was kind of a heavenly spot to discover on a hot day. So this is “Someday Johnson Creek”. It starts with an epigraph from Hilda Raz from her book “What Is Good”. “I have had this lesson not to care for the bones. Late in a trail hitch, grown brown with sun, solid with miles of climbs, I drop my pack by an alpine stream, cresting the ridge to watch for the others. Free of weight my chest a wide house of sky. These 500 yards could be life after death, an unending sprint with no need of rest. But if bad luck lets me die in a house instead of on bear grass send the body to school, let them learn what they can, so long as they grind the remains and spread them on these craggy peaks where the flies do their work with the sun.”</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep25.mp3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Download Podcast</a><br />

sbw306,First Trip In,"July 31, 2012",2012-07-31,Episode 24,sbw306.mp3,11:08,"In this episode, titled “First Trip In” Mary Erickson talks about falling in love with a wilderness area she hardly knew existed.

Mary Erickson grew up on a farm in Wisconsin, but fell in love with the wilderness when she visited her brother at the University of Montana.

<p><strong>Interviewee</strong>: Mary Erickson<br />
<strong>Interviewer</strong>: Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: Missoula, Montana<br />
<strong>Date</strong>: October 6, 2011</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, Mary, what I want to ask you first is if you can tell me about your background, where you grew up, and just any details that might be relevant to your later experience in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Well, I grew up in Wisconsin on a, essentially a truck farm and went to school there and went to school in Wisconsin, a couple of different colleges. And I think part of my growing up years created the interest that I have in the wilderness area and the reason, it was the reason I jumped at the job when I got one because as kids growing up we had fun, on probably five miles of countryside around our farm on lake shore and woods and marsh land, and things of that sort. And mom, God bless her, most of the time didn’t know where we were if we weren’t doing our designated jobs but, you know, she just felt very confident that we were safe wherever we were. So I was used to being kind of independent.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> In my exploration in nature so. And then I went to college in Wisconsin and my brother had come to the University of Montana to go to school, he transferred out here and I had to come visit him and once I got here I knew I couldn’t go home because it just was where I belonged and I was lucky enough to get, there was an ad in the paper for Selway Lodge. It didn’t say Selway Lodge, it said back country guest ranch looking for assistant cook. And I thought what the heck I can cook, been cooking for a family of nine. I’d done some commercial cooking, you know, what the heck. I’ll send them a resume and in those days you wrote a letter and you put it in the mail and then you waited, you know, two weeks or whatever to get it back. Well, I didn’t know that their mail was at that time going to Darby and they had flown out and picked it up. My girlfriend and I went to Glacier Park for four or five days and when I got back I had a note back from them, it was Pierces at Selway Lodge, that they were going to be interviewing me in Missoula the following week. I’d only planned to stay here like, well, two weeks but, you know, until the money ran out. And I called the phone number that they had left, they actually were out in town at the time and I spoke to Mr. Pierce on the phone and I said well how will I know you when I get to the airport for the interviews and he told me well you’ll be flying in in a little yellow and white plane and he always wore this red and white polka dot baseball cap, well, that won’t be hard to find. So we agreed upon a time to meet at the airport and I’m thinking wow, like, he has a plane where is this ranch. I didn’t really care though, you know, it was all adventure. And when I got to the airport the designated day I, the airport was a lot different than it is now. I went right to the windows and looked out over the tarmac and I just watched and I saw his little plane land and taxi in and I saw him get out and come walking in so I meet him at the door and introduced myself and we had a real great interview and when I walked out I, my brother had dropped me off and when he picked me up I said I got that job. I didn’t know yet but I said I got that job, I got to go get some hiking boots because it’s in the wilderness area.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> You didn’t know what?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> I’d never, well, I’d never, I mean yes it was constant, you have like pork and marsh and, you know, you have some mild country but not like out here.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> And so I went and bought gear. I got a sleeping bag, you know, whatever I thought I needed and they called later in the day and said I had the job. And so two days later I flew into the Selway and that was the beginning of all of it.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Wow. What year was that, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> ’71.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> And how old were you then?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> 21.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Wow. So your very first introduction was, did you fly in on the air field at Selway Lodge.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Oh, yes, I did.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Oh, yes, I did. That was an adventure too.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So tell us about your first kind of few days.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> I’d never been in a plane, any kind of plane, ever, to that point in time. Okay. He tells me has a, I saw the little plane, it, like, four people could sit in it. Okay. He’s going to pick me up in two days, meeting him at the airport, shoves my stuff in the back of the plane, get in the plane, he said, well it was a little rainy this morning so I wasn’t sure I was going to get out but I got out through a hole in the clouds and the weather’s is looking really good. So we head back in. I’ve never been in a plane before. I’m sitting up with the pilot and we flew down the Bitterroot. He picked me up here in Missoula and we flew down the Bitterroot and up over Lost Horse and down Bear Creek on the far side, which, of course, I didn’t know then. And as we were flying along first he lights up this little cigar. Okay, that’s not so good but then I was enthralled with seeing all this incredible country below me and all these little pocket lakes up in the mountain valleys and oh, my gosh, just incredible country until he started pointing out his emergency landing areas where his crashes are. See that little grove of aspens down there, if I ever have to put it down in this canyon that’s what I’m heading for. Okay, good, good, I’m relieved. We finally get down the canyon to the Selway River and we flew over the ranch and he tipped the wing so I could see the ranch house down below to let people there know that we were coming in to make sure horses weren’t on the air strip, something I would be doing a lot in my later days at Selway Lodge was clearing the air strip for planes. But, so we circled the strip and we went back to the mouth of Bear Creek and the plane turned around and as we’re coming down the river canyon there’s a mountain coming right at us, or we’re going at it, and so a ridge that comes down and Everett says it’s okay we’re going to pop over this. So we pop up over this little ridge and he sets it down hard in the end of the field and we’re zooming down the dirt runway which is just part of the pasture, no horses, zooming down the runway and we’re getting closer and closer to the house and there’s a rail fence along the house and all the family’s out to greet the plane and are all waving as we come in, they’re all waving to me and smiling, big hellos on their face, and we’re still going and as we go by the fence by the house their faces all changed to looks of abject horror and big Os for their mouths and I said to Everett is everything okay. He said ah, well, ah, the brakes aren’t working too good because the grass is wet. And there’s a mountain coming, right at the end of the airstrip is a mountain. Everett says we’re going to take the dog leg. Okay, and there’s a little beeper going beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. He said don’t worry about that. We didn’t hit the mountain. He kind of pulled the plane to the left and went around the edge of the mountain and there was another little piece of the meadow and that’s where we stopped the plane and turned around and taxied back down to the house. And everybody’s saying oh, thank God, nobody’s ever used the dog leg before. I was as happy to see them as they were to see me.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> How many people were in their family then?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Well, at the lodge at that time there was Freddie and Everett and Tom and Melany and Fred and then there were a couple other staff members there. And it was our tradition that I learned, I mean whenever a plane was coming in you went to the fence and, you know, waited for them because usually you stopped just past the house by the little barn, not clear up around the edge of the mountain on the dog leg.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Right. So your first, you know, you were just immediately immersed in this culture back here?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Oh, yah.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah. So what was that like?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> It was incredible. It was like I’d died and gone to heaven. You know, it was just, I mean it was such a beautiful place&#8230;</p>","<p>Additional stories from &#8220;Selway&#8221; Mary can be found <a href=""http://www.rockymountainrider.com/articles/2009/0809_Molene.htm"">here</a>.<br />

<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yah. Well, how would you answer that question what different people want from wilderness? You must have seen every different shape, size or desire back there for wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> Yah, and it was you saw all of it and I couldn’t, I don’t know. I mean, people would come by to me and say can I have some lemonade. Like they’re back for their wilderness experience but they’ve run out of lemonade. It’s like, well, drink water, you know. I have to bring all my stuff in here too. Why are you here, oh, river, the river people. It’s all about, I mean that’s a whole nuther thing this, you know, the obsession with the danger of the river and which I took a couple of little raft trips, I hitched rides. One of which I got out at Goat Creek. Two days later their raft had flipped and some horrible thing and everybody almost died. It was just awful but it was like God you idiots. What, what, why do you need to pit yourself against this perfectly nice piece of land that’s just doing its thing. You know, the river’s just running, just let it run. Why? But for some people it’s a challenge, it’s something they need to conquer, and for others it’s something that just can exist. For others it’s a place to live and it’s just where you happen to live. And certainly for me I just happened to have this series of events that plunked me there and I’m deeply fortunate about that but I, it wasn’t a, you know, it’s like being born in and living in Dixie. Yah, you know it’s like wow we’re going to go and live this. This is where my parents had their place and that’s where I grew up and we lived there and we worked in the bar. You know that’s what it is. And even though I didn’t grow up there it was just sort of a series of things that happened to me and I think more people tend to be like, oh, how nice and then they have an idea about it and I don’t understand that. Although one of my most conflicting, odd moments at Running Creek was mowing. You had to mow a lot because for fire and for snakes. Those were sort of the two things and how it was this whole aesthetic thing about the nice lawn. Dodie had had this fabulous lawn and it’s really important to maintain Dodie’s lawn. So I was, but I had a riding mower. So there I am with a riding mower wearing these little skimpy shorts and my braids 100 miles long, you know, driving around and the trail, the main river trail went right by my gate. You know, there’s this little fence and then there’s the main river trail and this guy came by and he sort of was watching me for a bit with these dark glasses. And so, you know, the mower didn’t start easily so I left it running and then went over and started to chat with him at the top of my lungs over the sound of the mower. And he was sort of asking about the place and it turned out it was Bill Worf who at that point was not yet blind. I guess he was going blind and it was one of his, his last trips into the Selway. And he had tried really hard to buy Running Creek because he was, very much wanted to buy all the private places and get rid of them and the Houghtons had outbid him because they could pay a million dollars or whatever it was they had paid and there was I running my damn lawn mower. I mean, it must have been such an awful thing for him. It’s like this is everything I didn’t want. And I’m having this chat with him. I don’t remember what we talked about or how I learned all that background but afterwards I just felt really small, you know, just. I mean, I was, it was my job. I was the caretaker. I didn’t own it or anything but at least I could have turned the damn mower off and, you know, made it be quiet so we could have a nice wilderness experience. But that was really peculiar that two completely opposite points of view about that wilderness meeting over that fence and he walked on his way and I climbed back on my mower and kept mowing. And there you have it, you know.</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> That’s a great story.</p>

sbw304,Defining Wilderness,"July 3, 2012",2012-07-03,Episode 22,sbw304.mp3,7:52,"In this episode, titled “Defining Wilderness,” Bill Worf, a tireless wilderness champion and lifelong conservationist, tells us in one of his last interviews about his passion for wilderness.

Although Bill passed on December 21, 2011, his legacy will be remembered as long as wilderness survives in this country. He spent his long life working to establish and preserve wilderness as a special, set-aside place where people were not allowed to interfere with Mother Nature. Bill was born in 1926 in Reed Point, Montana, was raised on a ranch near Rosebud during the Great Depression, fought in World War II in Iwo Jima, and then obtained his Bachelor of Science in Forestry in 1950 in Missoula. When the 1964 Wilderness Act was passed, Bill was assigned to Washington DC to lead the wilderness program, and his influence and interpretation were the guiding forces behind the wilderness fire policy of allowing naturally-occurring wildfire to burn, as well as the strict one-launch-per-day river policy, and the use of primitive non-motorized tools by trail maintenance crews.

After retiring from the Forest Service, Bill and his colleagues founded <a href=""http://wildernesswatch.org/about/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Wilderness Watch</a>, a non-profit organization dedication to maintaining the Wilderness Act in its entirety.

<p><strong>BM:</strong> Yah, I guess, Bill, I want to take not just you but all of us back like 41 years. And, you know, you do the math and that’s 1970 and you remember that I think as well as I do.</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> And it was the most monumental backpack trip I ever made in my life, Bill, because it was you and Orville and myself and Dave Aldrich.</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> And Bud Moore.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> And Bud Moore. The five. And there we were up by Cooper’s Flat.</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> With our tents up and our campfire talking to answer Jamie’s question, what are we going to do, how do we get started, what’s first, I mean how do we bring everybody along, it’s something brand new. So now here in 2011 I’d be really interested as you look back over the last 41 years to what, what you thought on that camp that we had at Cooper’s Flat, Bill, where we were really envisioning the role fire should play in wilderness and then where we’ve come to over these intervening 41 years to today. In other words, contrast what you wanted to see happen then to where we are today.</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> You don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Too big a question.</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Yah.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Where do you think, Bob? Bob, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Well, yah, before what I think, I mean what are your recollections of our campfire back there in the wilderness in ’70, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Oh, well, you mean as far as.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Yah, just the five of us together around the campfire.</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Well, we knew, I knew, you knew that we had to let mother nature play its role and that was our goal was to try to let that happen. And.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Did you guys have any disagreements?</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> I know.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> You were all of one mind?</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Pretty much, yah, yah, pretty much of one mind.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Well, through Wilderness Watch, Bill, in all these years and all your personal engagement after you retired do you think, you know, looking in from a Wilderness Watch perspective that the agency has kind of lived up to what your vision was back then?</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> With fire?</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> No, I’m afraid that the agency has lost track of what their mission was.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Uh-huh. In what way?</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Well, I think we, I think we wanted to make mother nature do our thing rather than, rather than us letting mother nature play its role.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Uh-huh, uh-huh. Kind of just superimpose our values on her natural system.</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> That’s right. Yah.</p>

Dick grew up in Missoula, and applied to work in the Forest Service at the age in 18 in the late 1960’s, right after the passage of the Wilderness Act.  Throughout college at the University of Montana, Dick spent the summers working in the wilderness, where he met and impressed Emil Keck, who oversaw his work maintaining trails and bridges.  Dick went on to work as a river ranger, providing vital information to the Forest Service toward what was to become the unique “one-launch-per-day” rafting policy.  He later smoke jumped, and earned his pilot’s license, working as a backcountry pilot and firefighter throughout the 1970’s and 80’s.

<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Could you walk me through what it’s like to do a smoke jump from, you know, a pilot and a smoke jumper’s point of view?  Do you, you know, how do you prepare, where are you supposed to drop, you know, what equipment, what do you do when you hit the ground?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  Well, from the jumper part of it, I mean that’s the tip of the spear, you know.  It’s a whole lot like a military action I think and people that have been in the military equate it to, you know, military type of operation.  But you’re, by the time you’re jumping fires for the Forest Service you’re pretty well trained.  The training is superb and they can take people, young men, who have never ever even been in an airplane let alone parachute jump before and within three weeks if you make it through the training you’re prepared.  And so the training is quite good.  The fire fighting, as far as the airplanes and parachute portion, the fire fighting portion they expect you to come in with that background already and that includes tool handling and chainsaws, you know, the tools of the trade.  You’ve already have that.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  So when you, say, you get a phone call that says we want you to jump this fire and so is everything already packed for you or do you go pack your own stuff?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  No, you’re expected and most of the fires the usual pattern was that lightning, and most of our fires were lightning type fires, and so a lightning storm would happen late in the afternoon and so if you were in Grangeville, for example, you were close by and they’d, you oftentimes were flying right behind the storms or during the storms, you know, you’d be seeing ground strikes.  Depending on the situation they could have somebody up just prioritizing fires at that time and just say okay we want you to go there, there, or there.  A lot of times you were on a fire within an hour of the lightning strike.  Other situations, yah, you might get a phone call and say we got a fire over in Wyoming and we’re going to leave Missoula at 4:30 and be over the fire just at first light.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  First light is like dawn?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  Yes, yah.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Yah, I see.</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  And you gotta have decent.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  You gotta see?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  You’ve got to be able to see.  So, but, we, I remember, they don’t do this so much now but in those days, in the ‘70s and ‘80s, they, you know, you’d take off at 4:00 in the morning and have to circle over the fire for 15 or 20 minutes until it got light and that was a great strategy.  I really like that because you’ve got, we have good air, jumping in the morning is way better than jumping in the afternoon just because of the.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Why?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>   The air currents.  Afternoon you have wind, it’s a lot hotter, thermals, the air is less dense.  Mornings great time to jump.  </p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  And do you land in the, obviously you land in trees?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  Sometimes.  You try to pick a spot near the fire that’s going to let you land on the ground and safely.  If you do have to land in trees they try to pick tight grouped trees, reprod, reproduction.  You’re not going to fall out of a tree and run into the side of a large 200 foot tall pine tree and not hang up.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  So, then, how do you get your parachute out of the trees?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  Well, there’s procedures for letting yourself out of the tree if you do hang up.  It’s called a let down and you learn that in your training and then every year you go through a refresher where you redo all of the procedures.  So the first thing is to get yourself down and out of the tree and you’re expected to be able to do that in a certain amount of time.  It’s usually less than 10 minutes and you can safely repel out of the tree.  You go and put out the fire and then you come back and get your chute.  You either climb the tree if it’s a large tree that you can safely climb or if smaller trees you just cut them down and retrieve your chute or pull it out.  But one way or the other you have to, the general practice is to climb the tree.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  So you have to be really physically fit?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Have you ever encountered anyone who couldn’t actually do it who had to kind of say I can’t handle this physically?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  No, but there’s a lot of people who didn’t like climbing trees, who never were comfortable.  I mean, everybody had to do it and one of the stations, the units is the ground school and they have an exit tower where you learn how to exit your plane.  They have a landing simulator where you learn how to do your landing rolls.  And they had tree climbing poles where you learned tree climbing techniques and there was always people that liked doing that or didn’t mind doing it and some people actually like it and I was one of the guys that kind of liked it.  </p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  I always liked being up and climbing and I was good at it.  It was never a problem.  And you could make a lot of beer by.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Getting other people’s.</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  By the people that didn’t like climbing you could get their chutes.  A lot of people over the years, you know, you just had a reputation if you were one of the guys that liked to climb and get the cargo.  I mean usually you were climbing for cargo more than you were for personnel chutes.  After the jumpers are all on the ground safely they dropped the, at a low altitude, the plane comes in and drops the cargo boxes that have a parachute on them also.  And they’re not steered, there’s nobody steering those chutes.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Right, right.</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  And it’s really dependent on the pilot’s skill because the pilot’s the one that’s positioning the plane and he also is the one that’s calling telling the people in the back when to throw their cargo out and so if you got a really good pilot who can get the cargo into a small spot then you don’t have to do as much climbing and that’s a good thing because you get to the fire quicker with your tools and it’s also you don’t have to spend the energy to go up and climb trees.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  When you were smoke jumping did you jump onto the Selway-Bitterroot very much or were you kind of all over?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  I was all over but I did make a number of jumps and most, I jumped right at Selway Lodge and the people who owned the lodge were back there with their clients and we jumped right in their airstrip.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Was that Freddie and?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  Freddie and Everett Pierce who I knew quite well because I had worked for them in Aspen one winter.  And I was in the back of the load.  It was when I was still early in my career so I wasn’t squad overhead and it was during the 1974, the Independence Fire, which was a large, and this was again early on in that whole Bob Mutch’s program of letting fires run their course in the wilderness and that particular fire, they called it the Independence Fire because it started on July 4th, and by then the smoke jumpers were calling it the Moose Creek Black Hole because we kept getting sucked back there and for the smoke jumpers those fires presented all kinds of problems for us because there was never any clear direction, how they wanted them, all they wanted us to do was to herd them and you don’t herd wildfire.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  So what does that mean to herd them?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  Well, they said we don’t want it to go here, it’s okay if it goes out this direction, but we don’t want it to go that direction.  And it’s, they talk about these safety issues and those fires were the situations that, you know, they talk about the 18 situations that shout watch out or the 18 standard fire fighter were all.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Oh, okay.  I see.</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  And one of them should be herding wildfires because that’s definitely a situation that shouts watch out.  You don’t have an anchor point.  That’s the main problem.  They tell you to, well we want you to start right here, you know.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Yah.</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  This particular fire had slopped over on the Bear Creek, it was about four miles up Bear Creek and it was burning on, it’s multi-thousand acres on one side and when it jumped across Bear Creek they didn’t want it to go, they wanted that controlled.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  But not the other side?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  But not the other side.  Which is, Bear Creek was a pretty good anchor and so, yah, that was.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  So what’s an anchor, that’s just?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  Well, where you start digging, as you move around the fire you want to be anchored in to something that’s, so the fire doesn’t come back around behind you.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  I see.</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  And so generally an anchor point is a river, a road, a rock slide, some kind of a natural spot that’s going to keep the fire from hooking around behind you.  And that’s, I mean, you learn that early on in your fire fighting career that you don’t just generally, unless you can see your anchor spot and it’s a small enough fire, or see where you started but as soon as you lose sight of where you started you either have to have people back there watching that or you have to have a real good strong anchor point.  A lot of those fires don’t have good anchor points, the management type.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  You mean the ones that are allowed to burn?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Yah.</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  Where they just tell you to go in and herd it.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Do they still herd fires?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  They still have a, yah, that’s still going on.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  And is it to protect the inholdings and structures back there or just?</p>
<p><strong>DH:</strong>  A lot of different reasons but, yah, and there’s all kinds of, things have progressed, you know, I mean there’s a lot of policies and a lot of techniques, strategies that have evolved over the years to kind of mitigate that but it in my mind it’s still a problem.  They haven’t solved it completely.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep21.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Download Podcast</a></p>

<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Warren Miller<br />
<strong>Interviewers:</strong> Debbie Lee and Jane Holman<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> near Peck, Idaho<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> May 6, 2011</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  So you, when did you start getting an interest in crosscut saws?</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Well, actually about the first year I was there at Moose Creek I got interested in crosscuts.  There, well, actually the first job I had was at Moose Creek was using crosscuts.  A fellow by the name of Clem Pope and I ended up cutting out the old wagon road from Moose Creek up to the Ranches.  I think that was the first task I had at Moose Creek using crosscuts.  And then after that he, Clem and I ended up going down the Selway to Selway Falls and worked our way back up the river doing trail maintenance up to Moose Creek.  This was before guard school and we had a saw with us and we did, of course, did some saw work then.  And that spring, I think it was that same spring, and, of course, the, needed to have the saws sharpened and so one of the outfitters, I can’t remember his name, ended up doing, ended up filing the crosscuts for the district.  I’d be sort of interested.  I didn’t actually watch him but I was aware of the process that you got to sharpen these things to make them work.  And I don’t know why, where I got interested in them but I just started getting curious about them and asked the people on the district what they knew about filing saws and again it was Clem Pope who knew more than about anybody else on the district but we’d go out in the saw shed and bang away on saws and things didn’t work out the way I thought they should and so I started pestering Emil Keck and says hey what do you know about this and he knew a little bit but not as much as, not enough to be able to answer the questions I had so he realized that both Clem and I were really interested in saws.  And he ended up on one of his trips to the Coast looking up a filer by the name of Martin Winters who was a fellow who’d filed for logging camps starting in about 1927 and filed in logging camps for a good part of his life and at that time when Emil and Penny went to visit him was retired but was still filing for contest sawyers and Emil came back and said you got to go over there and meet this fellow because he knows what he’s talking about and so the next, well that winter actually Clem and I and Mary Ferguson went up to Olympia and spent a day with him while he graciously sharpened a saw while we were watching and answered questions.  And he kind of put a bug in my ear about saws and filers and the whole aura of crosscuts and I spent the next two winters out on the Coast while I wasn’t working for Moose Creek looking for saws and saw filing tools and talking to as many filers as I could track down.  And what started off, you know, as a hobby just kind of exploded or got out of hand or I’m not sure.  It depends on your perspective.  But the work season after I had visited Martin and gotten a little bit of a handle on how to file them I started filing saws for the district and filed for the district from then on, from then until I quit in ’91.  But it didn’t really stop there because Bill Holman who’d been the ranger when I first got to Moose Creek had gone over to the regional office in Recreation and at the, not too long after he got there Missoula Equipment and Development Center had written a saw filing manual and Bill had gotten a hold of a couple of copies and send it in to me and Clem at Moose Creek and asked us to critique it after our introduction to them through Martin.  And we realized that the manual was pretty deficient and told, well told Bill Holman that and that got back to MTDC or MEDC.  It was then Missoula Equipment and Development Center.  It’s now Missoula Technical Development Center.  And so they invited me over to a meeting and I sat at a table with a whole bunch of engineers and told them what was wrong with their manual.  And at the end of this about a four hour session there said well it looks like we need to rewrite this thing and I think you’re probably the one to rewrite it.  How do you want to do this?  So I eventually did end up writing a new filing manual.  And that was distributed all over the country to Forest Service offices.  I think each district office grabbed a couple of copies and regional offices got half a dozen or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So what makes filing a crosscut saw so technical and so difficult?</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Um, well it’s, there’s a lot of different aspects that all have to work together.  You’ve got several different kinds of, or you’ve got two different kinds of teeth and they each, each has to be sharpened up, or treated in a particular way so that they work with each other.  A saw is not, a crosscut saw is not really a primitive tool because you’ve got, for it to work properly each of the teeth has to be filed essentially the same way in a very precise way so that it interacts most efficiently with the wood because unlike a power saw where you have a lot of power to muddle your way through a cut if the saws not sharpened properly your crosscut is human powered and humans don’t, well humans have a quarter of a horsepower at most that they can deal with and so you want a saw that, well you want a tool that is as efficient at cutting a log as you can make it.  And so in order to do that you have to have the interaction between the two different types of teeth on a saw, how to explain it.  I spend a week teaching people how to file saws and how to describe it in a couple minutes here.  Basically it’s just a, it’s a very precise, it’s a precision tool made up of a number of different parts all of which have to be working in concert with each other for it to work efficiently and that’s basically what makes it complicated.  It’s not, it’s not that each individual piece is very complex or difficult it’s just that they all have to be working together.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  And you now teach classes every year to young people, middle aged people that, how to.</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  All ages.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  How to sharpen and how to use them?  Or maybe.</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Not so much how to use them.  But I’ve been, for the last 21 years I’ve been teaching classes over at Nine Mile Ranger Station at the Wild Lands Training Center over there and how to, well, how to select, how to take care of, how to resurrect and sharpen crosscut saws.  That’s my primary, primary emphasis is actually on making them work.  I’ve done a little bit of training on using them but mostly it’s how to make them work.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  And how many different kinds of saws are there, brands?</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Well, there are three primary, three main brands of saws.  There was Simons, Disten, and Adkins were the primary companies but there were numerous smaller companies that made them.  Well, there was a company by the name of Old Bishop.  There was a number, there were a number of companies like, in fact, like Craftsman actually had a saw but I don’t think they manufactured their own.  It was actually manufactured by Adkins and then they just rebranded it.  But those were the primary, primary brands were Simons, Disten, and Adkins.  And they quit making, Simons was the last one that made them.  And there was a, actually a letter in the files at Moose Creek dated about 1967, I believe, from Simons Company to Moose Creek which was in response to an inquiry made by Moose Creek to Simons asking about saws in which it was stated that, I think it was 1967 or ’66 that their, was the last time they manufactured crosscuts.  So any saws that we’re currently using are leftovers from that period and prior.  And nobody at this point is making crosscuts that are worth a darn.  There’s a company back in Seneca Falls, New York, that manufactures crosscuts but they’re a poor imitation of the older saws.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Uh-huh.  Wow.</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  In workmanship and steel content and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  So do you see the crosscut saw as being an integral part to the spirit of wilderness because you have to deal with trees obviously in our wildernesses but you can’t use machines.</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Well, that becomes an interesting question and dilemma.  Of course, what happens when crosscuts wear out, I mean, because we have, we’re working on a limited supply of crosscuts and they eventually wear out as you sharpen and use them.  You know, there becomes a dilemma of okay what happens when you run out of saws.  Is there a possibility of interesting, or having some manufacturer actually remanufacture them?  Or do you just decide that the minimum tool no longer is a crosscut but it’s another type of tool, perhaps mechanized equipment?  So how do you deal with that dilemma?  </p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  So do quite a few saws have stories for you?  That’s just really interesting that saws hold, you know, history and stories.</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Not very many.  I mean, not that I know.  Not really.  All saws have stories but not, you know, I’m not aware of very many saws that have stories.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Personal.  Yah.  Uh-huh.  </p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Or of specific saws.  There was one saw that I do, that I filed every year.  It was a nice little four and a half footer that I’d made out of a five and a half foot saw.  I cut the ends off of it.  And it happened to have been left some place in the weather and apparently a small maple leaf had fallen onto it.  And it had been out in the weather and the maple leaf had kept the moisture and it had rusted the outline of that maple leaf right into the saw and it had been there long enough that it actually was etched right into the saw.  It was a delightful little pattern and very distinct.  And one of the trail crews latched a hold of that saw.  A gal who made that her saw and she actually named that saw.  So but every year when she came back to work she would ask for that particular saw which she could, of course, recognize by the maple leaf on it.  That was one of my more favorite saws just because of the distinctive pattern on it.  Pretty fun.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Do a lot of saws have names?</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  I don’t know.  The, I guess a lot of the saws at the Selway-Bitterroot Foundation have gotten named.  I’m sure a lot of saws have had, a lot of saws in the past have had names, not all of them complimentary.  But I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Yah.  </p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  I never named a saw.  I called a saw names but I’ve never named a saw.  </p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep20.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Download Podcast</a></p>

<strong>Location:</strong> near Peck, Idaho<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> May 6, 2011</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  So you went to, you went to be a wilderness ranger in 1971.</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  And you said you were there for 20 years.  Did you change positions or were you in that position?</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  I was wilderness ranger for 17 years.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  At Moose Creek?</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Well, I was working for the Moose Creek District but we, see the way the District was organized changed quite a bit after I’d been there a couple of years.  When I first, when I started working at Moose Creek everything worked out of Moose Creek Ranger Station itself which is right in the middle of the Selway-Bitterroot.  So it was, you know, the first couple of years was… When you’re at Moose Creek you’re at Moose Creek.  There wasn’t, essentially there wasn’t outside.  You were very much of a community and a lifestyle that really didn’t connect to the outside.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Can you go into more detail about what that entails, the community and the lifestyle?</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Ah, well, it was like any community.  I mean, you ended up helping each other, working with each other.  You, if somebody needed… you ended up cooperating with other people.  If you needed some supplies taken down, say, to Shearer you’d end up, you know, cooperating with somebody else who was going in that direction rather than making special trips.  It was a sense of community, you know.  Often during the four days off from our, you know, we’d work 10 fours, we’d have 10 days out in the field or 10 paid days or official paid days and then four days off during a two-week hitch.  And the crews who did come back in to the station, often we’d end up having a barbecue or an ice cream feed or something like that on the porch of the ranger’s house.  You know, Bill would have us come over and we’d end up, for the station people would have prior to that made ice cubes in the freezers in their refrigerators and so we’d have the old fashioned crank ice cream maker and we’d make ice cream on the ranger’s porch.  And have hamburgers and that kind of stuff.  It was just, it was a, in a lot of ways it was a very close community and developed the interactions and the relationships that small closed communities like that do end up developing.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Yah.  </p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong>  Good memories.  </p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong> And so I ended up going over to Lost Horse in 1973 to man that station and in a way it made a lot of sense because managing a wilderness is kind of an oxymoron.  Wilderness by definition doesn’t need to be managed, wilderness manages itself.  And what wilderness managers really are doing is managing people and mitigating the impacts of people on the wilderness resource.  And so most of that is education.  Some of it’s law enforcement for the recalcitrant people who refuse to be educated.  So it makes sense to talk to people before they go in to the wilderness and try to encourage them to using the low impact camping methods and try to instill in them a little bit of sense of what wilderness is, although again that’s a subjective sort of thing.  So it made sense to move the wilderness rangers to the external portals to contact the public.  Which is, I think it’s good.  It makes people a little bit more sensitive and aware to what wilderness is. </p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Yah.  So the Wilderness Act, I mean it’s specific in some ways, no roads, no machinery, but some of it’s the terminology is more vague and open to interpretation.  Did you find yourself having to make rules or enforce things that, you know, that had to do with the word untrammeled or the word un&#8211; solitude that are more abstract?</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Well, the Wilderness Act is pretty general.  There is room for enormous amounts of interpretation as you find just going from region to region.  You know, you find vastly different ways of interpreting the Wilderness Act.  Some, you know, regions for example take a lot more liberty with administrative privileges using power equipment or having administrative facilities than others so there’s enormous room for interpretation.  And, of course, that very thing leads or lead or innumerable conversations amongst the, and discussions amongst the people working there.  Well, what is wilderness?  How should we do this?  How should we do that?  Well, what’s the moral?  What’s the.  I mean, just.  It’s all very subjective.  </p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Yah.</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  And, you know, what is wilderness character of a place.  I mean, what is wilderness in the first place?  How do you define wilderness?  The Wilderness Act has certain definitions but, you know, it’s a lack of being a little bit, oh, what’s the word, vulgar.  A good friend of mine says you know, the opinions are like assholes everybody’s got one kind of thing.  And that’s the same thing in wilderness.  You know, no two people are going to have the same opinion about how, what it is and how it should be managed and what should be there, what shouldn’t be there.  Anywhere from Emil who said by golly anybody who comes in here ought to be just given a spear and a loincloth and let him deal on his own to other people who say you know you really ought to have a road up the Selway here so people can enjoy this place.  I mean, it’s two extremes of opinion about the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Yah.</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  And one of the interesting things that I found, that I had to deal with or dealt with in terms of wilderness and wilderness philosophy is man’s place in wilderness and the kind of, there’s an overlying impression that man really isn’t part of wilderness and I think man’s very much a part of wilderness and it’s sort of.  You know, I think that attitude of man being a part from wilderness is kind of a byproduct of the Judeo-Christian attitude that man has dominion over everything else when in reality man is part of everything else.  I mean, he’s just an organism just like anything else is and that took me a while to figure out how to, how that works in wilderness that.  You know, we are a part of this planet and we do have a part in wilderness and we are not a part of wilderness or a part from wilderness I should say.  And that was kind of an interesting realization that, you know, we are, we do belong here but we also need to take care of the place and make sure that we don’t make a mess out of it which, of course, is true of the planet in general but…</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep19.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Download Podcast</a></p>

Penny grew up on a farm near Portland, Oregon. While in college, she applied for and obtained a job as a fire lookout in the Moose Creek Ranger District in the summer of 1967. Her boss there was Emil Keck, whom she later married.  During the summers, Emil and Penny trained fire and trail crews, manned lookouts and assisted the Forest Rangers with equipment and other work. But during the off-season winters, they built or replaced many of the bridges that span creeks and rivers in the backcountry.  Without the use of heavy equipment or large crews, Penny and Emil Keck together built many of the astounding suspension bridges that lead hikers and hunters deep into the heart of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness.",Penny Keck,http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep18.mp3?_=7,"Penny Keck, 2011",https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/penny.jpg,sbw300_img.jpg,"[{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/4802372460_4ddebca2e4_b.jpg"",""id"":""533"",""title"":""4802372460_4ddebca2e4_b"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Cable suspension bridge over the Selway River."",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/wild2.jpg"",""id"":""534"",""title"":""wild2"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Forest Rangers examining the Goat Creek bridge in 1999.

<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Penny Keck<br />
<strong>Interviewers:</strong> Debbie Lee and Jane Holman<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Kooskia, Idaho<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> May 5, 2011</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong> And then in the winter because there was no traffic around most of the time we constructed the various bridges that were collapsing on various streams.  Occasionally we were at the Moose Creek Station where we put base logs in under a building or built, repaired some of the buildings there that were major repairs but the majority of the time we were out in a tent somewhere constructing a bridge.</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  So could, well like I’ve been back there many times and walked across those bridges but I and other people I’ve been back there with always wonder how you guys did it.  Can you walk me through a bridge building, you know, what does one do if one wants to build a bridge in the wilderness or repair a bridge?</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  One of the things, are talking first off girder span or a cable suspension?  </p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  I don’t know the difference.  Maybe you can explain that too.</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  Okay.  Some of them didn’t require your extensive, they weren’t that long and requiring cables.  They were called girder spans, anything from about 45 feet or less.  That’s an approximation.</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  And then what you do is, of course, is haul all your gear.  Well, the first thing is you’d hopefully the gods to be would give you a few dollars to do this project.  And then after that was accomplished and I’m sure the rangers did a lot of the paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong>  You guys would have to estimate the material though, right?</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  Oh, yes, everything.</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong>  I mean all the nails and cables and boards.</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  Once I was actually the leader instead of Emil.  I turned in the projects myself with estimates and everything.  Of course, with his awareness too and cooperation and tremendous knowledge.  So and I but I don’t know if Emil did a lot of that or not.  I have a strong suspicion that he just told the ranger and that was it.  I don’t honestly, can’t identify that but once that was occurring and the dollars came down we would then try to pack everything to the site in late fall.</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  With mules?</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  With mules, horses.  And have everything there and then we’d begin.  If it was a girder span that was built with native material and you’d begin falling the trees and getting them to the site.  If we could we could, we tried to fall those trees ahead of time.  We learned after the first bridge to fall them ahead of time, let them season with wood preservative on them so it’d absorb in them and do it.  And the cable suspension bridges we actually definitely did that and let them season and because a major failing for most bridges would fail in about 15 to 20 years we found out historically so every time you’d build a bridge you would tear the old one apart and find out where the weak areas were, why did this occur, how can I make an improvement so this will not occur as rapidly in the future.  So it was never a just tear apart and proceed to build.  You always tried to improve something, one way or the other.  And, for instance, on the cable suspension they had this little tiny plate up there where all of this weight of the bridge came over the cap on the tower.</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  Okay.</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  Well, chose to get a big plate to distribute it then the water was still a problem.  We put tar around it, etc. to reduce the water leakage into the bolted areas and the rebar areas but you still couldn’t prevent everything because actually I found out later tar is good only for two to three, four years and you need to, because it bubbles and then air and water will get through it.  And so you needed to redo this constantly which was interesting.  So I came up and suggested to Emil that we put a little cap over it, a little, and we did try that on the Three Links one.  Now I understand that a lot of people voiced the idea that this wasn’t part of wilderness.  It looked ugly.  And it’s true.  The bridge looks ugly, excuse me.  I’m sorry but it does.  Yuck.  But anyway.  And so we would proceed to get everything out, I mean, on the cable suspensions they were fascinating because you had to have gin poles up and even on the others gin poles up but the cable suspension took a little more effort.</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  So how would you get them up there?  Would you climb up there or to get the cables up or?</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  Well, first you let the, lifted the gin pole up and then you’d have the guy lines on it.  You’d lift it so it’d just be a little tipped, a little slant about five degrees or a little bit over the bridge because you wanted that a little bit over there because to lift that entire bridge up with that gin pole you needed to have it, there’s different methods this day and age.  We put it on the main cable which was usually an inch and a half, inch and three-quarter inch cable and proceeded to lift this off the tower, the cap and post and batter assembly which is termed a tower.  And then you could take the old tower off and bring, replace it with a new which was an interesting and you get all this rigging up there.  Yah, you had to climb the gin pole and put it up there.  </p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  So it was just the two of you would do the whole thing?</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  Yes.  </p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  So that in itself would take a lot of communication between you and Emil?</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  Yes.  And it was, you know, depending on the size of the bridge, sometimes it took us four months, sometimes it took us the Three Links which is 210 feet between towers plus approaches took us two years because we only did it in the  winter so it was two winters.  And so it.</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  So which bridges.  I know you worked on Dog Creek, right, and Three Links, and which other bridges did you guys work on back there that you recall?</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  Gold Creek, Bear Creek, Ditch Creek, Dog Creek, Halfway, Meeker.  We worked…</p>
<p><strong>J: </strong> Cub?</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong>  Cub?</p>
<p><strong>P: </strong> Yah, Cub.  I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  Well, that’s amazing right there.</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  I can’t recall all of them.</p>
<p><strong>D: </strong> And how many years did you guys do this, how many winters?</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  As I said I was back at Moose Creek for I believe 21 years and of those years and of the… we probably were on bridges over half the time in the winter.  Again because we were able to obtain some mechanized authority to use certain mechanized equipment at times.</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  Because on one rail on the cable suspension you had over 1,000 bolts on one.  There’s two rails.  Hello there that’d take you an arm and a leg of a lifetime to do.  And so some things were just to drill through 12 inches of wood with a hand is would have been entertaining.  Would have been.  But, you know, there are, the Forest Service at that time was semi-practical in the authorization of that which was beneficial.  But because of that you respected the public and therefore you chose to do this when the public would not be interfering with you or you interfering which is primarily the reason with the public.</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  Right.  The solitude thing?</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  So, okay, so you were out there all winter and so we’re interested in number one how did the snow and the ice interfere with the bridge builder or maybe even help with it and also did you ever see anyone, like how long would it be that you two, it was just you two for the, you know, the duration?</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  Most of the time it was us two for the duration.  But at times there was somebody would come.  It was a rarity but I believe only twice did we have people come.  And winters were interesting in that they slowed you up at times but it also made you respect certain things as well.  For instance, on the Goat Creek bridge the temperature was 29 below and therefore it was a little crispy crittered and because Emil didn’t like to hew I did all the hewing on the base timbers.  And you couldn’t lay out and hew, layout required no gloves, you’d only spend about an hour and then you’d have to go into the tent for about five minutes to warm up.  Then you’d go back out in that cold temperature.  The other thing you had to do is before darkness set in you had to pick up every item otherwise by the next morning you may not find it for several months.  Minor glitches but and it may be something you really needed because what you did is not only transport the hardware and stuff for the bridges in you also had to transport your food and items in as well.  And actually we surprisingly people wouldn’t grasp that we had fresh, some fresh food on the bridges because what we did is dig a hole, line it with the boughs, and then put our apples, oranges, and grapefruit, cabbage, carrots, onions in there.  They kept the longest, various foods, and then you’d remove them as you needed them and you’d cover it up with a just a, on top, a little sheet of plastic and then more boughs and then dirt over it.  And it kept it for all winter.  It was cool.</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  It wouldn’t freeze?</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  No.  And if you’ve ever tasted frozen grapefruit tell me you know it kiddos.  Biggie.  That’s pucker city.  </p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>  So were you guys ever tempted to go out for a, just to go out of the woods for a while and have a, you know, a meal at the Wilderness Inn or anything?</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong>  Actually no.  Once in a while we’d go out to visit my folks at Christmas but it wasn’t something that you looked forward to.  As a matter of fact, it was, I never looked forward to it at all.  It amazed me to be able to flick on a switch and have lights, don’t misunderstand me, but or even when we got back to Moose Creek we had a real pillow.  You know, in the winter camps it was our stupid jackets that served as pillows, not a pillow.  I mean, and so you realized how fortunate you were to be able to live in a time like this in which you did not have all these amenities.  </p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep18.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Download Podcast</a></p>

<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, what do you think is the biggest threat to wilderness, right now, at this point in time?</p>
<p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, it’s… I’m a little big conflicted.  Because of my experience of working with wilderness; I still work on these issues; I worked with the Central Idaho Wilderness Act down here.  Politics, I guess.  As congressmen, writing into the bills, though, that this is what wilderness is about.  You should be able to use motorized use.  You should be able to go in and do… dig with the diggers.  Build up big water tanks for grouse and birds to be able to feed, for bighorn sheep in Arizona, the bighorns have to have water, or they won’t survive.  Well, how did they survive for hundreds of thousands of years before we came along and said… and made it a wilderness, you know?  And we got to dig these big water tanks, and we have to bring diggers in there to do it. Those attacks are coming from politician, and they’re coming from some weakness within our own agency, to say no.  And that’s me… I don’t like to say that, because I love the forest service.  I loved my job; it was the best job in the world.  But, we’re making some decisions… We met the enemy, and it is us.  But it’s not coming just from us, it’s coming from politics.  Political pressure from motorized users that want more.  From dam people that own dams that want the convenience of using the power tools and so forth.  And the cheapness.  The expense.  So, those are the biggest threats.  That, plus air pollution, which we haven’t got any… no real handle on at all, yet, for a lot of wildernesses in our country.  Not these.  Not the Selway-Bitterroot, yet, although some acid rain probably has fallen on it, but all around our country, beautiful wildernesses that are near coal-fire plants or other places that throw out acid rain, we still have some serious problems there.  But to me, the biggest threat is still people that come up and want their own way with wilderness.  If they’re a politician, or if they’re inside the agency, or if they’re outside.  If they’re motorized users that want their own way, that want what they want, instead of looking at the act, and saying here’s the resource of wilderness, a place where we can look at that used to be this way, and say what have we done outside… how much have we changed the world?  I can go in there and see that the world hasn’t changed.  I haven’t changed.  Here’s what I am.  I have to depend on myself to protect myself from a bear or whatever it is that’s out there.  I have to keep… make shelter.  I have to keep warm.  We lose all that if we don’t maintain that.  So, the biggest threat is these people that want something for their own use.  Or want the comfort and convenience of doing it that way.  We get it from sheriffs, that, by gosh, we got to run in there to rescue people all the time.  We should have some radio towers, some cell towers, so we can… We don’t need that.  We’ve got to have some places where we’ve left civilization behind.  That’s what wilderness is all about.</p>
<p><strong>Penny Keck</strong></p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So what do you think the biggest threat to wilderness is then?</p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong>  Whew.  That’s an interesting question and I don’t know if I have the background, capability, knowledge to appropriately address that.  I can give you off beat responses but would they be.  I’d have to think about that for a while because of the fact that the threat to a wilderness.  I think it’s exterior, not interior, I know that.  But what?  Is it political because it can be removed with politics.  And, or is it the overall lifestyle of the earth.  In other words, the earth is reaching its carrying capacity.  It’s influencing the wilderness whether it’s through acid rain, through a lot of other items being slowly carried, transported somehow into the, I don’t know.  But it’s evolving and changing as we speak whether we, nothing is static.  But we are moving it more rapidly to a state that it probably wouldn’t move toward.  The biggest threat, I don’t think there’s no one biggest threat.  I think there’s several and it’ll be interesting to see in the future what that shall be.  </p>
<p><strong>Bruce Farling</strong></p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Okay, and what do you think the biggest threat to wilderness is? Right now?</p>
<p><strong>BF:</strong> Well, the whole array of human influences, obviously.  And in that array… The thing about the concept of wilderness, it’s a human construct, really.  There’s this thing out there; we call it wilderness, and this is the values we put on it.  But the value that is pretty meaningful is the whole idea is to have, sort of, nature function without human… or as minimal human influence as possible.  Now, we’ve been able to… you can do a pretty good job of that when it’s dealing with individuals going in there, you know, stay on this trail over here, don’t trash… you can deal with that.  You can minimize… but we now have these global influences that are really… that we’ve caused that are really huge.  Climate change is huge.  So, I think that is… and the other sort of… it’s not quite global, well, it is a global problem, but invasive species.  We’re moving stuff into these places, that sort of naturally functioning ecosystem doesn’t function naturally when all of a sudden you’re air-dropping these species that evolved from somewhere else in there, you know.  And obviously, we’ve got issues with weeds, and stuff like that, but there’s aquatic invasive species we’re really worried about showing up in places.  I don’t even think we’ve begun to conceive some of the stuff that could show up in a place like the Selway-Bitterroot that would be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Eric Melson</strong></p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Okay, I just have one more question.  What do you think the biggest threat to wilderness is?</p>
<p><strong>EM:</strong> The biggest threat to wilderness is, in my opinion, the lack of the younger generations’ use and appreciation.  I think that that would be number one on my list, and the whole concept of wilderness slowly being forgotten about.  It seems like in the 60s and 70s, with the environmental movement and all of that, there was this steam, the ball was rolling; it was a snowball effect, like it just got bigger and bigger and bigger, and people got behind it.  The whole idea of wilderness, I think is the greatest idea that America&#8217;s ever had.  To set aside land solely on the purpose of setting aside land for its values, and saving it for future generations, so that an ever-encroaching population can use it, not use it, but can enjoy it.   I think that with the influx in technology, and with iPhones and video games, and wanting it now, and just with technology in society, and the way that we are moving towards this fast-paced ever-evolving culture that it&#8217;s going to get forgotten about.  People are going to say, why did we do that again?   Like, what&#8217;s the point of all this again?  You know, when they&#8217;re all so busy with their iPhones and their Internet chat, and they have to update on their blog, and they have to Tweet things… that they won&#8217;t realize what they have in their backyard.  That, I think, is my main… is the single greatest threat, is that it&#8217;s going to get forgotten about, and that ball is going to slowly slow down and the momentum of the idea, and the culture behind wilderness… The leaders that we&#8217;ve had, the champions that created wilderness, and fought for it, and realized that it&#8217;s now or never, you know, we can save these areas now, or they can go on cutting these areas.  They can go on extracting these areas.  They can go on abusing these areas.  I think that positive experiences in wilderness are the only thing, the only way that it&#8217;s going to happen, and getting kids engaged in their natural areas around their homes, you know, the creek behind their house, building forts, snowball fights.  Little things like that.  Getting kids outside.  That&#8217;s the single greatest thing, is kids now are more focused on getting home, and getting the next level on their video game than they are about going in riding their bike, and jumping off of something, and breaking their arm, and you know?  What happened to the playgrounds with pea gravel where&#8217;d you get scrapes, and you have rocks embedded in your shoulder.  It&#8217;s become easier now; there&#8217;s foam mats because parents get mad, because the kids came home with scraped knees and it&#8217;s the school&#8217;s fault because they have pea gravel.  And, like, we as a society have gotten soft.  We really have, and wilderness will never get soft.  It&#8217;s always hard.  It&#8217;s always going to be difficult, and we need that.  We have to have that because it&#8217;s where we came from, and it gives us a chance to go back to that.  It gives us a chance to go back to a landscape that was never touched, and never will be touched, and technology doesn&#8217;t belong there.  Mechanized, mechanical things don&#8217;t belong there.  It&#8217;s human power, and it&#8217;s going to be hard, and we need it, and I think that technology, and the combination of the lack of interest from younger generations are the single greatest thing that are compromising wilderness right now,  in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Mason</strong></p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So what do you feel is the biggest threat to wilderness?  Maybe not just the Selways but to Wilderness in general?</p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Well, you could talk about short-term and long-term threats.  The long-term threat, I know Eric and I talked about this.  I would totally agree with what he said.  Unquestionably the biggest long-term threat is awareness in the American public of what wilderness is and why it’s important.  Without that awareness, it puts into question the ability to have political support for wilderness, and while we like to think of wilderness as this place that’s protected and whatever, and the reality is that it’s not.  Politics made the protection of the Selway possible, and continue to make it possible, but some day, if the support isn’t there politically to protect these areas, they could just as easily get turned back into a non-wilderness area.  So I would definitely say the biggest threat is the awareness in the American public about the value of protecting places, as wilderness.  As untrammeled areas.  I wouldn’t even say it has to be wilderness.  Just protecting places in general for qualities that are important to an ecosystem.  That allow humans and other things to thrive.  That provide those benefits.  Clean water, clean air, seed beds of genetic diversity, which is hugely important to the world, and certainly to humans.  So there’s other short-term threats.  The biggest short-term threat in the Selway is unquestionably weeds.  Invasive weeds.  Of course you can get into the argument of what’s… are invasive weeds natural or not natural, and that is an important argument to have, but if you just take the premise that invasive weeds aren’t natural, then that’s a huge threat that’s incredibly hard to control.  It definitely is changing the character of the wilderness and will continue to, in terms of hydrology, in terms of vegetation, in terms of habitat for species, and therefore species themselves.  I guess that’s what I would say is the biggest threats to wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>Warren Miller</strong></p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Well, Warren, what do you think is the biggest threat to wilderness?</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Uhm.  Huh.  Well, the first thing that comes to mind is apathy.  And a, the lack or the change of demographics for the lack of anything else from a rural to an urban environment where.  I think a large percentage of the population is so out of contact with the world that supports them that they don’t have any vestment in the world that supports them and consequently there is not a sense of need to support that.  So that in order to maintain a resource which wilderness is I think you have to have support for it because there are lots of forces that are interested in extracting resources from wilderness and unless you have a counterbalance to that the, you know, the extractive forces will prevail.  And just the fact that wilderness has been legislated by Congress means that it can be unlegislated if there’s enough interest and pressure to do that.  So that’s, I think that’s one of the biggest concerns that I have is that there’s not, the biggest threat is a lack of support base or a diminishing support base is I think what most concerns me.  I mean, there are the things which, of course, will modify wilderness, things like global warming and that, but I, that’s not a, to me that’s not a threat in the same sense that dewilderness, what’s the word I want to use.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Declassifying.</p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Declassifying wilderness, thanks, is and the resulting mayhem that that can result in.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Yah.  </p>
<p><strong>WM:</strong>  Yah, that’s, I mean, I suspect that in the environment that we have now that you probably would not be able to create wilderness because there’s just not the support for it, or create wilderness in the same way that it was done, you know, prior to 1964.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep17.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Download Podcast</a></p>"
sbw298,Domesticity,"May 1, 2012",2012-05-01,Episode 16,sbw298.mp3,9:47,"In this episode, titled “Domesticity,” we hear from Sarah Swett, with stories about her first backcountry employers, Punk and Carolyn Wolfenbarger, owners of the North Star ranch.  For several years, Sarah lived and worked on outfitter ranches in the heart of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, and knew many of the long-time residents of the area.  Originally from Brooklyn, she fell in love with the West, the wilderness and with the fibers and textiles that she has used to tell her stories.  Although life on a wilderness ranch involved long hours of work, cooking, caring for livestock, making hay, fixing fence or repairing buildings, Sarah used to get up at 4:00 am to knit and weave and spin, creating stories in pictures much like the stories told up and down the river in the backcountry.

<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Debbie Lee and Jane Holman<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Moscow, Idaho<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> May 11, 2011</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>:  This was at North Star.</p>
<p><strong>SS</strong>:  That was at North Star.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>:  Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SS</strong>:  So that was the first.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>:  And what year was this?</p>
<p><strong>SS</strong>:  That was, well, that was 1979 that we first went in so it was the spring of 1980, it was May.  Came out to Peck actually and literally took my stuff out of the vehicle we were in, it was Ian’s vehicle, and put it in Five Eight Dog, Dick’s then airplane, and Dick took me in and dropped me off&#8211; bye.  There I was with Punk for my new job.  And ended up not leaving the Selway, not leaving that even immediate area, for nine months.  So that was my first chunk and it was the first, it was a very, to me it made perfect sense.  It was very domestic.  Instantly we had to be pruning the raspberries and digging up the garden and mowing and cooking and I learned what Punk liked for breakfast and I learned what Punk liked, the kind of cookies he liked at 10:00 in the morning to go with his cup of coffee.  And Carolyn came in shortly thereafter.  I think she was concerned at the time that I was in there by myself and that Punk wouldn’t show me how to run stuff properly so she who had been in the midst of chemo, I mean I was 19 and she was 70, she came in and started teaching me stuff.  And half of my job it later turned out, half of my job was helping just doing physical labor, gardening, cooking, haying, all that stuff.  The other half was being Carolyn’s companion and doing all the stuff Carolyn would normally have done which again at that end of the Selway for people who lived in there year-round, full time was a lot of gardening, a lot of canning, a lot of berry picking, wine making.  I believe we made 116 gallons of wine which we made in garbage cans, 20 gallon garbage cans, mostly whatever was around, service berries, chokecherry, elderberry.</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>:  Not rhubarb?</p>
<p><strong>SS</strong>:  They did not have enough rhubarb.  We made raspberry sometimes if there was enough raspberries but the idea for them was that Carolyn was a very social person and people came by and they expected, they’d been coming for years, they lived in there for 30 years so, year-round.  They had people stopping by all the time, Forest Service teams, everyone and they were hospitable.  So if someone comes by you offer them a drink.  But who’s going to be packing in beer.  You can’t pack in beer.  So you make wine.  You can pack in sugar.  Sugar is much easier to pack in and you certainly weren’t going to pack in anything that you couldn’t pick there.  So the idea was to use the stuff that grew wild.  So a lot of our time or my time, not Carolyn’s so much then, was spent picking berries which was a long and honorable tradition.  I learned much Doty, George and Doty who had lived at Running Creek until a few years before and Doty used to wear, I guess, these huge high snake boots because she was terrified of rattlesnakes which, of course, were very prevalent there and on the lawn and sometimes meandering into the house and such.  So that you do watch out.  But if you have to pick four gallons of berries for every barrel of wine, it’s a lot of time outside in the brush picking berries.  </p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>:  So you spent a lot of time with Carolyn.  How would you describe her?  I don’t think we’ve talked to anyone who knew her that intimately.  </p>
<p><strong>SS</strong>:  Well, I mean, the first thing is wonderful.  She was wonderful.  She&#8230; brusque, extremely brusque at times.  But also extremely kind and interesting and very interested.  She had a&#8230; I think some things were hard for me because something that she, she loved and valued education.  She’s grown up in Darby and had been able to go to the University of Montana for one year and then had not been able to afford to continue to go.  Ended up working in Cutbank running a bar and eventually ran her own bar in Darby and that’s where she met Punk and had her own house and had a, you know, had made a life for herself and ended up then marrying Punk and moving into the Selway.  But she never was able to go back to college and because I had left Harvard of all places she really felt that I should go back and that it was kind of a waste although she tried not to say that because at the same time she needed to, like it’s, you know, people are okay who don’t but don’t throw away that education which I was all about throwing it away.  I was like, but Carolyn I’m so much more interested in what you know than in what they know.  So she wrote poetry.  She recited poetry.  She read endlessly.  We talked a lot about books.  She would give me books.  They read a lot of <em>Reader’s Digest Condensed Books</em> which I had never seen in my life before but became a great consumer of.  After nine months I’d read pretty much everything there which was great, very peaceful.  She and Punk and I in the evenings after a hard day’s work we would read and then we would talk about them.  A couple of my favorite Carolyn stories, one had to do with cooking and because I love to cook and I thought I was a pretty good cook and I learned to cook on a wood stove and she really educated me on how, you know, you need this kind of wood and this shape wood for this, you know, for making bread versus making this versus making that versus cooking the hotcakes that you make every single day, hotcakes cooked on top of the stove, mix up the sourdough the night before.  All, it was very, very ritualized, very steady which suits me down to the ground because I love routine and I love, you know, to know things but then I got in trouble for some things like the first time, well, probably the third time I cooked green beans when we had them in the garden and Carolyn said oh you fixed them this way again.  Well, uhm, yes, I had lightly steamed them with a little butter and salt and pepper.  And I had learned at that point to say well, Carolyn, and I said what’s wrong with them.  And she said they’re inedible.  Oh, okay, so how would you fix them Carolyn.  Nope, you cut them into small pieces and you cut up some bacon and you cook them with onion and bacon for at least 20 minutes until they’re tender.  You can digest them.  Okay, so from then on that was it for steamed green beans.  And interestingly by the end of the nine months of living there I had so adopted her ways of cooking that when I was with some other friends they’re like Sarah you’re peeling the potatoes, why are you, you never used to peel potatoes.  Well, right, you don’t actually have to any more.  </p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep16.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Download Podcast</a></p>"

<strong>Location:</strong> Missoula, Montana<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> April 14, 2011</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Bob, can you tell me when you first… like what was your very first experience in the land that’s the Selway-Bitterroot that you can remember?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> That’s pretty easy, because it’s such a memorable moment for me, I guess.  It goes all the way back to 1970, and although I knew there was a Selway-Bitterroot over the mountains from Missoula, and I smokejumped in Missoula in ’54 and ‘5.  I guess I’m going to have to take that back, because on my very first fire jump, come to think of it, right now, sitting with you, it was a fire in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness.  It was a two-person fire in 1954 was my first fire jump.  So, I’m mistaken in thinking that ’70 was my first experience in the Selway.  I guess I come by it very honestly, that fire and the Selway and Bob Mutch go all the way back to when I was in college in Michigan and smoke jumping out in Missoula.  I think it was a little place called Hamby Point.  HAMBY.  You might check that on a map, but it was a little two-person fire, and I jumped with a veteran smoke jumper: Ed Wain on this fire, that was just a single snag that was struck by lightning, like so many fires are.  It was easy to put a line around, and fell the snag, and put it out.  We hiked out a couple of days later.  That was interesting to discover for myself, that my roots go back in the Selway further than I had remembered.  That’s the beauty of an oral history, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So then in 1970, you returned?  In what capacity then?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> In 1970, it was my more official and more long-lasting tie to the Selway-Bitterroot, My daughter at that time, yeah, 1970, born in 1960, she was ten years old.  She loved the outdoors.  I said, Linda, how would you like to go on a backpack trip this weekend into the Selway?  So, we drive from Missoula 135 miles to Paradise, park at the guard station, hike up to Cooper’s Flat Cabin, eight and a half miles with our backpacks.  Linda had a little Trapper Nelson pack, and she still rues the day that she had this uncomfortable, terrible, torture-rack pack as a little kid, going up Whitecap Creek for eight and a half miles.  We got to Cooper’s Flat, and had a nice supper there, had use of the cabin.  The next day, we made a day trip up high on a trail up behind Cooper’s Flat to a place called Vance Point.  I took several pictures of Linda, and took pictures of Linda pointing the big fire scars on Ponderosa Pine.  I used to go over there, you know, nights and weekends and summers.  It was just Bob Mutch, and his forest.  It did something.  I always value programming, I’m sure, big time, and it stuck, and it really meant something to me.  Talk about value programming, I just have to mention Linda, because I started out talking about Linda when she was ten.  For those three years we were doing the Whitecap study, she liked that first backpack, even though she didn’t like the Trapper Nelson, and I had to get her a better pack.  For many, many of my ten-day-on, four-day-off hitches that I did for the next two or three years, the next summer, I would ask Linda, would you like to go in with me, I’m going in for ten days, and I’d love to have your company.  She went in with me at ten, eleven, twelve years old.  I didn’t know this at the time… you talk about wilderness…</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Do you want me to stop it?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> No, I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> You’re not the first person…</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> You talk about wilderness and its effect on people, but this story always gets me, because wilderness is about nature, but just as important, it’s about people in nature, and the effect of nature on people, and the effect of people on nature.  I didn’t know it at the time when Linda accompanied me on trip after trip in the Selway, actually helping me with my vegetation plot-work, and we’re in there ten days, and we camped out, and campfires at night, and backpacks, and freeze-dried meals, to the point where both of us were glad to get back to town for a milkshake after ten days in the woods.  Some time in that period, or shortly after it, I went to hear a psychologist from the University of Colorado, Boulder, speak, and he was a very well-known psychologist, and he was very, very theatrical in his presentations.  He was so good, that the Forest Service hired him to do workshops for Forest Service employees, because the title of at least one of his presentations that made such a huge impression on me, was simply this: You are what you were when.  In other words, when we were nine, ten, eleven, twelve, we had little control over…we were value programming for the rest of our lives, and what we were exposed to at those young years were going to live with us for the rest of our lives, he said, unless someone gave you a significant emotional experience that somehow was able to change those views that were absolutely in your blood, and in your psyche.  I realized when I heard him, because Linda grew up through high school years to become very excellent, you talked about English, and an English background, and an English career.  Linda really enjoyed English.  She became a great writer.  She wrote lots of good things.  She doesn’t have enough time now, but she likes to write poetry, and has written stories.  But, as I read her themes in high school, I thought to myself, oh my god, the psychologist was right.  Almost everything she wrote about went back to being ten, eleven and twelve with her dad in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness on this fire project.  It was a love for nature, an appreciation for nature, knowing the names of plants and animals, being able to understand some of the interconnections.  Understanding the importance of fire, and all this, because she got, at our campfire talks, she got to be an audience of one, and as her father probably went on too much for her, as he told stories about plants and animals, and their adaptations to fire, she went on to do her Master’s degree at the University of Arizona Tree-Ring Lab in a wonderful fire-related tree ring study on giant Sequoia trees.  So, her initiation in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, I’m sure, made her who she is today.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong>  Are there any fire behaviors that the public isn’t… like if you had to say what some of interesting fire behaviors that you think are fascinating, but that most people don’t know about?  What would those be?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Yeah, there are some features. And yeah, I think you’re right that… Yeah, this might be, kind of way far out for a fire person, but I think, you know, fire phenomenon could be as fascinating of a wilderness resource as anything else you’re in wilderness for.  In Yellowstone in ’88, for example, they went a long ways, even on very active fire days when Yellowstone was really burned over.  Many of the fires there were allowed to burn, and finally many were suppressed, because there were too much.  But people were allowed in Yellowstone to witness and see fires.  One of my most memorable sights in Yellowstone—I was working there for a month with my daughter, who was then a Park Service employee, and working on the fires right along with me, in fact she met my plane from Washington DC when I landed in West Yellowstone.  We were both in yellow shirts.  Worked together there for a month, this little girl on the fires back there, what ’88 to 1960.  She was 28 then.  28 years old, and we were working together.  One of the most fascinating days… I mean it was the most fascinating event I’ve ever seen on a fire in my life.  That’s 58 years, I guess, this year, thinking and working on fires.  But we were in at Old Faithful, the day Old Faithful burned over by the North Fork Fire, and this fire that was started by two chainsaw… people cutting firewood over on the Targhee National Forest just south of West Yellowstone weeks earlier, and a spark from their chainsaw most likely started this fire.  It started there, burned 4,000 acres.  Before it was done, the Park Superintendent, who I highly admire, Bob Barbee, up in Mammoth at Park Headquarters, had to give an evacuation notice to his employees at Mammoth, miles away from where the fire started.  If you’re familiar, West Yellowstone, the Mammoth Junction, then north to Gardiner.  The fire went that far, and he was telling his people in Headquarters housing to get out, because the fire might come in to Park Headquarters.  Well, on the seventh of September, Linda and I went in to Old Faithful Inn, because all eyes were focused on Old Faithful Inn.  Old Faithful Inn is probably the world’s largest shake roof, and if anything was going to burn and make a media story, it would be Old Faithful Inn, burning to the ground in a fire in Yellowstone National Park, our first national park.  So, we drove in there.  We’d driven there earlier in the day, and not much was going on.  A lot of tourists were there at noon.  Sunny skies, and we left, and we drove back in about four o’clock, and by four o’clock, we looked off to the west, and there was smoke coming from the North Fork fire, and it was lined up squarely on the Old Faithful complex.  It was pretty much deserted by then, but we went off by the geyser basin.  There were firefighters everywhere.  Went by the geyser basin, and there were some concession employees that hadn’t been evacuated, and they were huddled in the geyser basin, and this old, huge Old Faithful geyser basin was, you know, kind of gravel and stone.  Nothing there that would burn.  It was the safety zone at that point in time, and there were ABC, NBC, CBS had huge vans.  There were huge dishes that were this big around aimed at the satellites.  Everyone had their cameras focused on Old Faithful Inn, waiting for what they thought would be an unbelievable story, probably.  They had a sprinkler system on the roof.  There were sprinklers everywhere.  There was just a deluge, a torrent of water coming off the eaves everywhere of this shake roof, because the Park Service was doing everything they could to keep this national icon from burning.  So, Linda and I went over to… after we had made the rounds, and looked to see what was going on, we went into the safety zone.  You didn’t have to be too smart to realize that’s where you wanted to be if you wanted to be safe, because there were 17 outbuildings that were destroyed in that afternoon at that very time.  You could see that spot fire embers were going over the whole complex.  They were landing a half-mile downwind from Old Faithful geyser basin, and they started a fire in Lodgepole Pine that was burning actively.  People… I took some pictures of it… there were people… men and women, concession employees… they had bandannas around their face.  They looked absolutely miserable.  You could hardly see from me to you, the smoke was so bad.  There were tears in their eyes from smoke irritation.  In the midst of all of this, there was this huge roar.  I mean an unbelievable roar.  Someone said, oh, my God, is that the fire?  Is the fire here?  We all looked around, and someone else said, no, that’s Old Faithful going off.  We can’t see it!  The thermal heat… this is amazing.  I actually wrote a poem about this 20 years later.  I mean this poem just came out of nowhere, and I wrote this poem.  I was there.  In the poem, and at the time, too, I thought, wow, here’s this thermal heat, underground that goes off almost like clockwork.  So regularly that the time is posted at the Inn when to go over there with your camera and get ready to take a picture, and everybody congregates like a magnet to Old Faithful.  But that day, the thermal heat of a geyser basin was upstaged by the combustion heat of a Lodgepole Pine crown fire.  It was absolutely lost in the Lodgepole Pine smoke.  I thought, good for Lodgepole Pine.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Right, there’s a lot of power in that.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> That was memorable enough, but that wasn’t the most memorable event.  Later that evening, there were many of us there that wanted to get back to West Yellowstone because we were working.  Area Command said no, you can’t go down until a Park Ranger escorts you back to Madison Junction, because there’s fire now, burning on both sides of the road, and we just can’t have cars, even official cars, going down there randomly.  Someone could get in trouble, or there’s a lot of smoke.  You could go off the road.  So, we started down there, and there was an entourage behind us.  It was a Park Ranger, and I forget her name now, but she had… she couldn’t manage us, at all, because we’d go a little ways down the road, and we got to the Fire Hole River, aptly named, that day, and on the far side of the Fire Hole River, there was this steep mountain slope across this meadow, and that whole mountain slope was going up in a crown fire.  I mean, from top to bottom, it was an orange-red crown fire, and in the Fire Hole basin meadow, there was a herd of maybe 30-40 bison.  They were single-file.  They weren’t running in panic.  They weren’t scared.  They weren’t worried.  They must have had genes that told them from way past that this is going to be okay.  And you know their coat, it’s really dark brown, almost black.  They must have been a perfect absorbing body for radiant heat.  They must have felt the heat from that slope that was burning behind them, but they ambled along, they’d put a head down, they’d graze, they’d walk, they’d graze, they’d walk, they stayed pretty much single file, and what the Ranger had trouble… all of us of course would stop periodically.  It was the picture of a lifetime.  The elk and the crown fire in Yellowstone.  We took picture after picture of this scene, and it was remarkable.  She needed a cattle prod, because every once in a while, she’d come along by all this line of cars, and say no, we got to go now.  The bison are trying to cross… there was a ford just ahead that we didn’t know about, and that’s where they were headed.  She knew if we were there that we would interrupt them from crossing this ford.  She knew their behavior that well.  So, she finally got us down the road, but I tell you, that after seeing fire after fire after fire for decades, that image is indelibly inscribed in my memory as a wilderness resource.  Bar none.  Where are you going to see anything like that?  </p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep15.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Download Podcast</a></p>"

Bob Mutch retired from a 38¬-year career in wildland fire research and management with the U.S. Forest Service in 1994. In the mid¬ 1950s, he worked as a Forest Service smokejumper in Missoula, MT. Bob later served 11 years as a Fire Behavior Analyst on a national Type 1 Fire Management Team. A highlight of his career was the development of the first Forest Service Plan to allow wildland fires to burn in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness to restore an important natural process.  Bob holds a Bachelor of Arts in Biology and English from Albion College in Michigan and a Master of Science in Fire Management (M.S.F.) degree from the University of Montana. In 2007, in acknowledgement of his ongoing accomplishments in the national and international wildland fire arenas, Bob was presented with an Honorary Doctoral Degree in Forestry from the University of Montana.

<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Bob Mutch<br />
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Missoula, Montana<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> April 14, 2011</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, was the whitecap study area, was there a fire there already? </p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Why did Bud choose that area?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> That’s interesting, yeah.  I guess it could have been anywhere in this region.  I guess it was partly chosen because there are landforms and vegetation types there that are represented through much of Region 1 of the Forest Service and the northern Rocky Mountains.  We had open Ponderosa Pine savanna, pine trees and grass.  We had north slope Grand Fir, Doug Fir, Lodgepole Pine communities.  We had south slope Doug Fir, Ponderosa Pine, Doug Fir Communities.  We had a large area, 54% was in the subalpine type, that high elevation country we love to backpack in, lots of granite rock and open vistas, and subalpine fir and White Bark Pine.  So, it had it all.  The Bitterroot… the feature on the Bitterroot is they had a Forest Supervisor that this wasn’t a casual interest.  He wanted it.  I mean, when you talk to Orville Daniels, you know this was really important to him, just from a philosophical standpoint for good land management, that it’s not right to suppress a natural process like fire in a wilderness, where fire has been molding the landscape for eons, for thousands of years.  So, it had a good person to host it in Orville.  It was like the fire lab and forestry sciences laboratory.  We had some good research support nearby, and everyone agreed that this is a good place to do it.  It also had a good… (this is important too) you wouldn’t want to pick and area that didn’t have any fires, especially if you’re going to allow lightning fires to burn.  The records had been looked at, and lightning caused more than 90% of the fire starts back 45 years were started by lightning.  So, it’s a natural outdoor laboratory, if there ever was one, both from a human standpoint, people committed and interested, from a vegetation standpoint, from a meteorological standpoint, that the lightning source was there.  Indeed, when that plan was approved, we would have fires.  When we had the plan approved, we would talk more about it a little bit later, the plan was approved two years later, the fire study started that year in ’70.  We pretty well presented the plan to the chief of the Forest Service, John Maguire and his staff in July of ’72.  Two years later we had a plan that was about that thick, and had all the do’s and don’ts, and had all the criteria, and how we’d manage fire, and which fires we might put out.  The chief, almost on the spot in Washington DC, and we were all sitting around the big table; it was very formal.  Just Orville and I, and gave him a briefing, and John went around the room, asked all of his staff what they thought of this, and not everyone was in accord.  </p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So were you nervous?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Yeah, I was a little nervous, because he was well-respected in Forest Service circles.  But we went around the room, and he raised that a little bit.  Of course, I’d briefed Orville.  Orville was able to cover the wilderness base as well, in a briefing before we’d even opened up the discussion.  When it went around the room, this guy said a few things, but yeah, John Maguire before it was over said I like the sounds of what we’re doing, and we’re going to give you our verbal approval today, and you’ll be getting our final formal approval very quickly.  I just say that, because two weeks later, my daughter Linda and I, I think it was early August; we were back in the wilderness doing some more vegetation work, and I got a call on my Forest Service radio.  It was Hamilton Dispatch, through a repeater, and they said, Bob, we’ve just had a new lightning fire over in Bad Luck Creek.  Here we are, only two weeks on a plan, and we had a fire.  They said, we want you to hike out to Paradise, and we’re going to have a helicopter there.   It’s maybe not the best from a wilderness standpoint, but they were treating it as an emergency, partly, and we could use helicopters for emergencies.  They said there’ll be a helicopter there, and we’re going to take you over and drop you off, and we want your on-the-ground assessment of this fire.  We’ve sort of tentatively decided it’s one that should burn, but we want you to take a look at it and report back before we give it our final approval.  So, I was dropped off.  I mean it was 24 feet by 24 feet.  It was another, like my Hamby Creek fire.  Another nothing fire.  Another one of those lightning strikes, and a snag, and burning in a shrub field.  In four days, it never got beyond 24 by 24 feet, and it went out.  I mean, it just went out.  There was a lesson there too, that sometimes there’s a knee-jerk reaction that every fire’s a bad fire.  Well, maybe yeah, maybe not.  In wilderness, most likely not.  I had decided I didn’t need the helicopter, and they just continued on their other business and it wasn’t that far, and I hiked down to the Selway, and up to Paradise, and to the cabin where I’d left Linda for the day.  I talked to the SO and Dispatch in Hamilton, and it was our first fire.  Yeah, it was the Bad Luck Fire.  Yeah, it was in Bad Luck Creek.  Some thought that it wasn’t a very good name, but for our very first fire, but it turned out…</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, What did you guys learn then?  How long were you on that project, that study project?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> You know, we started in ’70 with the little introductory deal.  Get acquainted.  Got in the project area.  The rest of ’70, ’71, ’72 we were doing all the field work.  We did fire history work, to learn about the frequency of fires, looking at fire scars on Ponderosa Pine, that keeps fire scars intact going back two or three hundred years.  We learned, like people learn everywhere from Ponderosa Pine, in Arizona, New Mexico, to Montana and Idaho, that in Ponderosa Pine, because of the flammability of the needles, and the fire behavior in Ponderosa Pine stands, that fires occur on the average, about every ten to fifteen years.  There was that periodicity, frequency of fire, about every ten to fifteen years going back, say, two or three hundred years, all the way up to about 1900, 1910, 1920 when the Forest Service moves onto the scene and starts putting fires out.  There’s an unbelievable marked decline in fire scars in Ponderosa Pine from that time forward.  For decades, we kept fires out of a plant community where fires were part and parcel of the health of that community.  We did fire history work, we did fuels work, we did fire behavior work, we had some hydrologists come in and do some stream work.  After one of our fires, we had a fisheries… I think she was a… she was either a Master’s or a PhD student at the University of Montana, and she came in, and did a post-fire aquatic insect survey within the Fitz Creek Fire, downstream from where it started, and upstream where there was no fire effect, in about four or five miles of the riparian zone had burned pretty intensely, in the fire that summer of ’73, and she did a pretty detailed study of: was there any measurable effect of really heavy burning on aquatic insects above, in, and below the fire.  Her conclusion as I remember it was that aquatic insects recolonize so quickly that she really couldn’t detect anything of significance.  We did a soil… had a morphologist do some landscape work, identifying the various landscape types.  These five vegetation zones I described to you earlier: shrub field, pine savannah, south slope, north slope and subalpine, those became… finally you get all this information, Debbie, and you think, wow, what does all this mean?  What are we going to do?  We’ve got to have some thread.  We have to have some continuity. When it came down to putting the plan together, we had all these pieces of data, and all kinds of stuff.  We started, and we laid it all out on these five geographical, ecological land units.  We called them ELUs: Ecological Land Units.  Landform, and soils, and vegetation, pretty much defining physically and biologically what they are, and what its capacity is.  Finally… and fire behavior was different, obviously, in the subalpine, where it’s long winters, short summers, not very productive, not a lot of plant growth, not a lot of fuels over time, like there is in the north slope, a more moist community.  So, fire behavior, fuels, fire history, natural breaks due to rock formations, and things like that… all kind of fit together like pieces in a puzzle.  We decided to put it all together, and we suddenly realized that we can be very liberal up here in the 54% that is subalpine.  It’s high, like that Sequoia/King’s Canyon.  They drew a line at 7,000 feet and said that anything above it is pretty much free to do what it wants to do, with some limitations.  So, the pieces fit together, and the Doug Fir, Ponderosa Pine south slope unit, where we identified frequent fire, and then no fire, we realized that… and there were a lot of ladder fuels in the absence of fire, a lot of Douglas Fir grows up that would have been killed by those fires every ten or twelve years.  The stands were not as open as they would have been historically.  There’s more fuel.  There was enough more fuel in the crown fire potential, where the typical historical fire would have been a low-intensity surface fire, because fires burn so often, there wasn’t a lot to burn.  If you’re burning every ten years… So, we realized that we had the most effect through fire suppression on that south slope Ponderosa Pine/Douglas Fir unit, and we were most conservative in our prescriptions there, meaning that we didn’t allow any fires starting at the beginning of the fire season to burn there.  We just put in more or less a calendar date.  So, if it was late in the fire season, and we didn’t have months, we just had weeks, maybe, left in the fire season, before wet weather would start in late August, early September, at that point on the calendar, we would begin to evaluate those fires with the thought that we could allow some to burn gradually getting to the point as we get fires over time where you wouldn’t have to draw those kinds of conclusions, and be that conservative any more.  Which we didn’t do after a while, so the pieces fell together that way.  It was fun to put it together.  It seemed to make sense.  Most the people that we talked to thought it was a good idea.  Not everybody did.  There was a Western… I wish I would have brought a copy of that journal with us… there’s a Western Wildland… It’s one I could send you if you really want to see it, but a special journal put out by the University of Montana Forestry school, and they covered different issues.  I think it was quarterly.  This particular issue was a fire issue, and it was after our Fitz Creek Fire of ’73.  It had just came out.  I had an article in it titled “I Thought Forest Fires Were Black.”  One of our field assistants came in two weeks after… his girlfriend came in.  Two weeks after the fire was over, and the shower of Ponderosa Pine needles, some of it natural fall needle drop anyway, Ponderosa Pine, you know, drops the older needles every fall, but some of it was scorched needles coming down.  This surface of that Ponderosa Pine savannah area that the trail goes up through to Bad Luck Lookout… the whole forest area that had been black two weeks earlier, was now a golden mantle of pine needles.  She hiked in there with us.  We were going up the trail to the lookout tower, and she said to Tim, Tim, I thought forest fires were black!  She said these are golden.  In fact, there was such a carpet of golden needles that if someone… if there had been an ignition source, you could have had another fire over this mantle of golden Ponderosa Pine needles two weeks after the first fire went through that stand.  Anyway, that was one article.  Bud Moore has an article in there, and Orville Daniels has an article in there, all talking to this experience of the change in philosophy and thinking of the Forest Service towards fire.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, was the Whitecap study program a kind of first then?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> It really was.  It was the pilot project in the Forest Service.  As you know now, the Park Service had preceded this effort, getting their park lightning fire plan approved in 1968.  That was partly due to the Starker-Leopold report.  Starker was that professor at UC Berkeley, who wrote kind of a white paper for the Park Service.  You should be managing for the natural processes, the natural systems.  Suppressing fire is one of the most unnatural things you could be doing.  That was their impetus, to get them going.  Our impetus was the Wilderness Act of 1964 that Bud Moore or Bill Warf was so instrumental… he wrote kind of the guidelines on how the Forest Service would implement the Wilderness Act.  He was called back to Washington to write the regulations that directed the Forest Service from that point forward.  How will it implement the Wilderness Act in Forest Service Wilderness?  So, he was a student of that act, and of course Bud had the visions for fire: it needs to be on the land, not removed from the wilderness, and Orville the dedicated Forest Supervisor, and lucky Dave and I to go on the ground for two or three years or so.  To answer the rest of your question, there we were, two years later, had the approval in July.  First small fire that August ’72.  Next year, big fire, started in July of… I think it was July or early August of ’73.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> That’s the Fitz Creek Fire?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> That’s the Fitz Creek fire.  Then, we continued some of our monitoring evaluation work.  I stayed kind of tied to the effort probably through the rest of ’73, ’74, ’75… working out of the fire lab.  Dave was somewhat still involved out of the Bitterroot.  Just kind of keeping tabs of what was going on in there.  It was…now it’s to the point where it was just like a brush fire that started in the Bad Luck Creek brush field, in ’72, allowed to burn, like brush fires do, if the idea’s right.  This germ was well-fertilized, and pretty soon the whole Selway had a plan.  Piece by piece: first it was Whitecap, then it was Moose Creek, then it was up on the Clearwater part.  </p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Do you mean like the Moose Creek District?</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Moose Creek District.  Was added later.  Yeah, the whole district went under a plan.  The rest of the Bitterroot and the West Fork District went under a plan.  The Bitterroot was kind of piecemeal, where once this caught on, then the Heatley Wilderness in New Mexico, and the Boundary Waters Canoe area was another one to follow shortly afterward, to the point now where I would imagine most large wildernesses in the Forest Service have a fire management plan.  </p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> That’s&#8230; So, the conclusion that I’m drawing is that if wilderness were to go away, then let burn policy would go away, and that would be a really big loss for the environment.</p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong>  Part of the story we haven’t told yet, to answer the rest of your question… the thing that’s interesting about wilderness fire is that it was so right for wilderness that it has been exported outside wilderness.  We are using it in large tracts of land where we can have a plan to allow fire to burn outside wilderness to achieve other benefits, not the wilderness resource benefits; maybe it’s wildlife, maybe it’s hazard reduction, maybe it’s aesthetically desirable to have some fires, maybe it’s to sustain plants and animals outside wilderness that are fire-dependent.  So, there have been some really good examples of extending this idea to lands outside wilderness as well.  So, that’s one lesson that we learned and applied.  There’s another lesson that I don’t think any of us, none of the original five ever envisioned when we started this snowball rolling downhill, that this would be an outcome, and it’s a very satisfying outcome to the program.  And what we’ve discovered now that we’ve allowed fires to burn year after year, decade after decade for three-plus decades now, under all kinds of weather conditions, all kind of fire behavior conditions, from low to moderate to high to very high, even to extreme fire danger conditions, that if the conditions are rights, we’ve had some fire burning in wilderness even then.  Those fires burning under every conceivable kind of weather and fuels and topography have left us a legacy on the landscape.  Some have called it, I think one was Penny Morgan at University of Idaho who’s such a good fire ecologist.  She calls it a fire-smart landscape.  Meaning simply this: that now we’ve learned finally that when we allow a fire to burn, in 2004 or 2005 or 2006, those fires are being self-regulated by previous fires that have been allowed to burn the landscape.  In other words, Mother Nature has been rolling the dice now so long in the Selway-Bitterroot the fuels have been broken up into such a mosaic of recent, sort of recent, not-so-recent, thirty years ago recent… fuels and mosaics and vegetation situations that now, when we have a fire, a fire this year is going to burn into a fire of some recent past.  The fire behavior is going to change drastically, and the fire may not go out, but it’s going to change dramatically in character, and where we used to be concerned, and we still should be concerned about a fire burning across the wilderness boundary into lands outside wilderness and causing unwanted effects, we don’t want that to happen, but the fires are sort of taking care of themselves now, which is, to me, a wonderful footnote to this whole story.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> It is, yeah.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep14b.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Download Podcast</a></p>"

<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Debbie Lee and Jane Holman<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> March 22, 2011<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Cambridge, Idaho</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> You mentioned that there are a number of airplanes in Fish Lake.  Can you talk about how many you think there are, and some of the reasons why they’re there?</p>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> Well, I know the history of some of them.  The first one that crashed was an Air Coupe.  That was an aircraft that had the unique ability to be flown only by the yoke.  You didn’t have to have rudder pedals.  It was interconnected.  Underpowered, and really should not have been at Fish Lake at 5,000 foot.  I mean, sea level elevation, and by the time you add in the temperature and everything, well, the density-altitude was much greater.  That airplane made it completely across the lake, since the lake butted into the airport, and crashed on the other side in some rocks.  For a number of years, you could ride by, and you could see the aluminum parts of that airplane.  Jim was there at one point in time when an aircraft took off and crashed into the lake again, during the heat of the day, when they shouldn’t have been flying.  Someone was close to the lake and other fishermen, and I can remember that Jim hopped onto a horse bareback with some ropes, and galloped that horse all the way down more than a mile and a half to the point where the airplane could be seen with the tail sticking up out of the water.  The fishermen down there was a swimmer, and I think the story goes that they took a log or something, and ropes out to the airplane, tied it to the tail, and then he dove to try to retrieve the occupants, and was unsuccessful.  You know, you can wind-break a horse by pushing them too hard, and Jim did that with that particular horse.  That was not a healthy thing to do.  Another aircraft took off, and I wasn’t there, but I got in on the aftermath of it all.  It was a Super Cub with two people, and they made it off the ground.  He couldn’t climb high enough to get over the trees at the end of the lake, but he had enough room to make a circle around the lake.  Now why he decided not to bank back to the airport and set down, I don’t know.  I suspect that he was a better pilot than I was.  He came back around, and decided I’m going to make this, so I’m going to put it in close to shore.  So he put it into a slip, and slid it within probably fifteen feet of the shore, and set it into the water.  Both of those guys walked out of there.  Now, that airplane sat there for a while, and that fall, while I was packing and guiding, and had a little bit of time on my hands, I went down to look at it.  The engine had already been removed.  The electronics had been removed.  The only thing that was there was the pilot’s seat, and I was thinking, boy, we need something soft to sit on at camp.  So, I was in there taking this thing apart, and we had a hunter that was a moose hunter, no an elk hunter, that was across the lake.  He may have had his fishing pole with him at the time, because… I think he was… he was fishing over there.  I didn’t know he was there.  There was a moose that came up the little spot of land behind him, and had him trapped.  He was off over there waving to me, and trying to get my attention, and I was oblivious.  I had no idea he was over there.  Went on about my work of removing the seat, and taking it back to camp.  I heard about that that night from that fellow.  There was no way that I could have helped him, but he was definitely in distress.  There must have been either eight or nine aircraft that crashed into that lake, all of them because of density-altitude.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Can you explain what Density-Altitude is?</p>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> As the air becomes heated, it has less molecules available to create the lift to the wing that is necessary.  I witnessed some very close calls.  A group of hunters flew in with a 182, landed, and they were loaded to the hilt.  There were four people in there, and they had all of their gear.  They let one person out while they went to search an area that they might hunt on.  Came back and landed, and decided they would go to Moose Creek.  As the fellow was standing there beside, me, I said, you know, when he comes back and picks you up, just as a private pilot, I would suggest that you wait a few hours before you take off.  Well, that pilot knew better than I, and he got in, and they took off all right, but they used every bit of that runway to get off the ground, and very lucky to have made it.  Another time was when Lee Atkins was flying elk for us, out of Fish Lake, and we had some snow on the ground.  It was just enough snow that he couldn’t quite get it off the ground.  He made three passes down the runway, and at the windsock, he would shut it down, and then you could see him just sliding, and slowing it down, and then he would turn around and come back.  He got out of the airplane, and came over, and you couldn’t tell that he was shaken up at all.  You knew he was nervous enough because he shut the airplane down, then he came over to talk to me.  He says, okay, I’m going to try it one more time, and if it’s not off of the ground by the time I hit the air sock, I’m just going to have to unload part of this, and leave.  Fortunately, he got off the ground and left.  But he was calling it close.  Another airplane experience at Fish Lake was one fall when someone flew in from Florida with a rented Cessna 180 plane.  He was taken out to a spite camp, but before he went out, he was talking with a family friend of ours, and helper, Stan Heppler, who had been a pilot, and had many hundreds of thousands of hours under his belt.  He said, Stan, if you want to use the airplane, the key’s on the dipstick, just go ahead.  We had another person there who was trying to find a moose.  Stan said, let’s go out and search.  We can see where they are, and then come back and tell him (because it’s illegal to spot game from an aircraft, and then immediately contact the hunter).  So, one morning bright and early, we went down to the airport, and Stan and I got into the aircraft, and I know better.  He should have known better.  It was cold that morning.  Very cold.  He primed the engine, and it wouldn’t start.  He primed it a second time.  It wouldn’t start.  He was an experienced pilot, and he should have known better.  He primed it a third time.  It spit and sputtered, and then we had a flame in the engine.  I jumped out, and ran to the cabin at Fish Lake, grabbed the fire extinguisher on the outside; he reached under the pilot’s seat and got that one.  We got the fire out.  But you can’t fly an airplane that’s been on fire.  So, that airplane sat on the runway for about a week while a mechanic was flown in from Orofino, and they pulled it up to the cabin, and they raised the engine out of it, and tore the whole thing apart, and put it back together.  It was a good thing that that pilot had renter’s insurance, because I’m sure that it cost him $20,000.  That was…</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Could you just tell someone maybe who hasn’t been to Fish Lake why getting up is difficult, like it’s in a canyon, right?</p>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> It’s a one-way airstrip for most pilots.  One or two people have landed the opposite way, but it’s not recommended.  You know, one of the reasons that it’s a little bit difficult getting up is because you do have a lake at the end of it, and air temperature changes there.  So, you want to be off the ground, and then you can fly down the canyon if you would like.  It’s the difference in altitude, density-altitude, and the change in temperature over the lake that makes it critical that you get altitude in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> And then you have to fly over… saddles, and peaks?</p>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> Well, you do, but you also have the opportunity of going down the Lochsa, if necessary, and many times, pilots did that in the fall when the cloud cover was low.  They would scud-run, if you wish.  That was always interesting.  Coming out of Moose Creek, I flew out with a pilot one time in a Super Cub.  It was below the cloud level, and it started snowing on us.  So, as we were flying down the river canyon, there were several opportunities to make a wrong turn.  You could either turn up Meadow Creek, or you could turn up Gedney Creek, or you could stay with the river.  As we were going, he would be flying, and I would say, right, or left, and he would immediately correct, which was probably what happened with Joe Rosencrantz out of Moose Creek Ranches, who left one fall and it was not good weather, and he flew down the river, and crashed… the story was that he’d had all the money from people there at Moose Creek Ranches with him, and rumors spread that he had escaped the country, and there was a big search for him.  I think they had the National Guard out.  They had… I know that Stan Heppler was on the search.  It gave me an opportunity over the years after that, because his plane wasn’t located for I don’t know, 20 years or so?</p>
<p><strong>JH:</strong> At least.</p>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> To look in all of the various places that would’ve hidden an airplane.  I was consciously riding and looking… hmmm… in a lake?  How about that brush patch?  You know, always looking for evidence.  They did find him off of Gedney Creek, and some of the hunters that were in that area that night… a few years later, I learned, had heard something down in that area.  This was from Phil Robinette’s relatives.  It was probably the crash.  They were a mountainside over, so, a drainage over.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep13.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Download Podcast</a></p>

<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Allen Renshaw<br />
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Debbie Lee and Jane Holman<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> March 22, 2011<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Cambridge, Idaho</p>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> Well, okay.  I was born in Kooskia, Idaho to Alvin and Elna Renshaw, who owned the Selway Lodge.  Spent the first 8 years, and a little bit over, of my life kind of off and on at the Selway Lodge, between there and Kooskia.  We did have a hunting and fishing lodge, and Dad spent his time serving guests there.  He was also involved with packing for the Forest Service from time to time.  So, I became involved with the clients that were there.  Sometimes getting in their way, I’m sure, as a young child.  The stay at the Selway Lodge was a unique experience, because I was the youngest of the family by 8 years, younger than my brother, my nearest sibling.  That in and of itself has created a difference in memories, of experience between Jean and Jim and my sister Billie and I.  The experience there was unique in the fact that not only was I growing up kind of as a lonely, well, maybe not lonely, but only child.  But having just the freedom to kind of do what I wanted to do, and experience the clients that came from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences, and of the one experience with the prisoners of war that were stationed at Bear Creek, the ranger station just downriver from the Selway Lodge.  As they were redoing the bridge that crossed the Selway River.  I was one that was surrounded by people that had pistols and rifles, and so I had my own pop guns, and I can remember one day sitting out on the… or standing out on the porch and seeing the prisoners of war cross the river on the sand bar, and probably taking a break, and I was going bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!  Looking back on it now, I was thinking gee, this is war time.  Prisoners of war.  That probably wasn’t taken too well.  Some of them were extremely of good natured.  One of them fell over in the sand, and the others covered him up with sand. A couple more grabbed a couple of sticks and made a cross and stuck in the sand over his head.  I thought wow!  This is fun, and they’re kind of playing with me.  The next day I walked out onto the bridge with my little pop-gun.  It was a cap gun type of affair, and was going bang, bang, bang, bang, expecting the same thing, and actually one of them laid down on the sand, but there was one individual who came up on the bridge, and says lemme see your pistol.  I handed it over to him.  He proceeded to throw it into the river.  Well, I heard this outcry from the people in the sand, and a couple of them came up, and chewed him out, and dove into the river to retrieve my pistol.  Looking back on it now, I guess, and with a little bit of information from my siblings, that particular prisoner was not Italian like the rest of them, but a German.  Took much offense at me shooting.  It must have been a week or two after all of that, that the prisoners were taken out to town, why, I have no idea, but returned and one of the Italian prisoners had a small suit of clothes that was designed to replicate naval people.  It was for his son, actually.  But he came over and gave it to me.  I think maybe this was kind of his way of saying I’m sorry for the incident that happened.  I have no idea where that suit is located now, but that was pleasing.  It was a very rewarding experience.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Do you know where these prisoners were stationed when they weren’t building?  Were they just kind of shuttled around the country to different projects?  Do you know much about that history?</p>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> I don’t know that much about that.   They may have come out of the Missoula area, because I know there was a Prisoner of War camp in Missoula.  I understand that they were Merchant Marines, and that they were essentially detained in port in California, and then shipped to the back woods of Idaho.  No, there’s not too much information that I have about them.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Wow, that’s really interesting. So, I understand, you have a couple bear stories, or at least one that you can tell us about.</p>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> Oh, yes.  There was a point in time when my dad was building a meat house.  You needed someplace to keep meat cool, and the flies away from it, and so forth, until it was transported out.  He was utilizing shakes, long shakes, to build the sides and the roof, and some wire around for the cooling.  He had cut down a cedar tree in Ditch Creek. We were to… Jim and I… were to go up to the tree, and pack down the shake bolts.  The long pieces of cedar that were to be split into shakes.  This one particular trip, I think I talked myself into it.  I don’t know that Jim really wanted me along.  I was ahead on my horse, Midget, and Jim was following behind with his pack-string.  We had a young cocker spaniel named Rusty.  Rusty always had her nose down, and was searching all over the territory, and ran ahead of us up the trail.  Well, pretty soon, we saw Rusty coming, running back around this outside turn of the trail, and right behind her was a big, black bear.  All at once… both of us stopped.  I mean, here we were, the bear was coming, and then suddenly stopped.  The pack string and all of the horses stopped.  We were wondering what’s going to happen next?  Because Rusty had run between all of the legs of the horses and the mules, back behind, to get out of the way of the bear.  Jim says, start yelling.  So we started yelling.  The bear kind of looked at us, and pretty soon walked off the trail.  This was a mother bear, we discovered, because she had sent her cubs up a tree, and she got her cubs down, and they crossed the drainage and up the other side.  So, we could have had pandemonium there if the bear had continued coming, and although I was on a very gentle horse, that gentle horse would have probably have not liked to have met that bear.  That shook us up, and remains in my memory.  There was another time when there was a bear that kept coming in around our house, around the lodge.  The dogs would go out and bark like everything.  It was always in the evening, it seemed.  We had some hunters that had just arrived, and they were distributed to the various guest cabins, and we were in the living room around the fire, enjoying conversation, and the heat of the stove, and the dogs started barking.  Dad says, it’s that bear.  Says, you guys go get your guns.  We’ll see if we can’t get this bear.  The dog chased the bear down across the yard, and up a tree near the river’s edge.  Two of the hunters went down and shot at the bear, and the bear fell down at the base of the tree. Since it was dark, there really wasn’t any light down there to dress the bear out, so they got a great, big tub, or washtub, and went down, loaded the bear into the tub, brought it up in front of the porch, and laid it out to dress it, and Dad reached down to cut its throat, the first thing that you generally do.  It opens its eyes.  They had only grazed it.  Here this bear was coming to, and Dad says, go get my pistol.  Well, somebody ran to get the pistol.  I was on the porch.  I ran in and crawled under the bed while he finished off the bear.  Now, it really wasn’t a danger, I guess, but I wasn’t going to take any chances!</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> That’s great, yeah.  You guys had a few neighbors… I mean the neighbors were miles away, but can you talk about your relationships with the people at Running Creek and North Star during those years?  Who was there, and how did you interact… on what occasions?</p>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> I was fairly young when I was there.  The Horrace boys were living upstream, and also…</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> At Running Creek?</p>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> At Running Creek.  And the Wolfenbargers had North Star.  Olie would come down frequently.  Punk would come down… his son would come down frequently.  The Horrace boys… you know, I think I met them a couple of times, but I can remember one time spending some time at their house with our family.  It was obviously… it had to do with cattle, because it was probably our cattle, and maybe part of their cattle, and it was during the summertime, so there was probably… they needed to have some salt put out to them or something.  The Horrace boys had a garden, just outside of their cabin.  I mean just outside of their cabin.  They had a rather interesting weeder.  It ran on a wheel, and a couple of times it ran into the ground, and you’d push that along in front of you.  I was out there trying that out one day, and it hit something.  It stopped me suddenly, and I had been listening to the vocabulary of adults for some time, and tried using a lot of that vocabulary.  Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, right outside of the window of my… of the cabin my mother and father were in.  My father came out, and let’s put it succinctly, tanned my hide.  I no longer used that vocabulary in front of him.  That same cabin, the memory is clear on some of the things that they had there.  Number one, it was a long cabin.  So you entered a porch, and then the main living room/kitchen/dining room area, then beyond that was a smaller room, was the bedroom.  Very dark.  I don’t even know if it had a window into.  There were at least two, perhaps three beds in there.  Out on the porch was a small apparatus that I was to learn was to make candles with.  That image has stayed in my mind all of these years. It was something that you poured beeswax into after you strung the wicks thorough, and then turned it upside down, and then it had the ability to open, and there you had a candle.  </p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, I get the impression that you and your siblings are uncommonly close, for siblings.  Do you think that has anything to do with that time you spent at Selway Lodge?</p>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> I think the general experience of living there certainly has something in common.  Close?  Well, I don’t know about that.  Depends what you mean by close.  Closeness?  Yeah.  I’ll keep ‘em.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> I guess I was just thinking how a particular piece of land keeps people together, and not just you and your siblings, but you and your spouse, and your children, and there is sort of an intergenerational legacy created because of that piece of land.</p>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> There is that, certainly.  Because they’ve all heard the stories of the Selway.  It’s…It gives them a sense of heritage, and that was started with Mom and Dad.  It started much earlier than that, because his dad was on the Selway.  And did packing and guiding, and so it’s one of the reasons that the drainage Renshaw Creek was named, after them.  I know that my dad and my grandfather had probably experienced the Upper Selway country too, and it’s a sense of curiosity, and it’s a sense of pride, that they existed in that area, and they existed, I think, with a certain amount of integrity.  That doesn’t mean that they didn’t do things that they shouldn’t have done.  But the combination of people that we ran into, Forest Service workers… when we were first in there in the early 40’s, and 30’s, there was a sense of helping one another that came through very strongly.  I think that society has led us a little bit away from that now.  That’s kind of sad.  You know, where else do you get away from the distractions of modern life?  Where else do you experience the smells of pine trees?  The sound of crows?  Along the river, the sound of river, and the awareness that as you climb a hill, away from the river, the sense of silence then.  Where else do you find the opportunity to sit in the saddle and be with yourself and dream?  It’s a little bit like going to church.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep12.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Download Podcast</a></p>"

<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Missoula, MT<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> April 20, 2011</p>
<p><strong>MB:</strong> And then you find yourself writing letters at Moose Creek on the table, and you’re writing the same thing over and over again.  You’re like, this hitch I saw five bears.  I’m okay, though.  Bears aren’t scary.  And you’re writing all this stuff to people who don’t have any idea.  I picture zooming out.  Like there’s certain people here in Missoula who know what wilderness is, and know that I use crosscuts and not chainsaws, and know why.  Then there’s people back in New England, where I’m from, who have no idea about wilderness, no idea about Idaho, and that’s the hardest part about… the hardest part for me was… coming out of both ears was… all these crazy stories.  Not even stories, just like feelings, like, I don’t know. Feelings that are the only way to feel at that point.  People are like… you come out, like so, how was it?  You’re like, I can’t put this in a tiny box for you.  Trying to put it in a tiny box undermines every aspect of why I go out there, because it’s an all-encompassing, pervasive thing in my life.  But people are like, oh, so what happened?  Like, where were you on the Fourth of July?  I don’t know where I was on the Fourth of July!  Probably working.  So, it’s good to have… that’s the negative side, but people who are… who do know what crosscuts are, and what Wilderness is, with a capital “W”… those are great people to talk to.  That’s what I realize, going into the woods, is we don’t see a lot of people out there, but the people we do see out there, are some of the most quality people.  </p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, can you think of any experiences where you’ve had to depend on people in ways that you don’t in the front country? Or vice versa?</p>
<p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah, definitely.  Last year, we were at Isaac Lake, and it was, what, July 31st, and there hadn’t been a thunderstorm yet.  This was a long day for us.  We started at East Moose.  We hiked up Double Ridge, and we were just cutting trees.  We were going to camp at Double Ridge.  There were these… there used to be a lookout there, but they just took the lightning rod off of it and it blew up.  There’s tons of glass all over the place.  We were going to camp there, but geographically, we looked at it, and it’s kind of in a bend in East Moose. Not an elbow bend, but still a bend, and all the weather that came from the west (that’s where the weather comes from) was spraying right into this ridge, and we decided that we’d radio the LAL, the Latent Activity Level.  All that stuff was telling us it was probably better not to camp at this spot, probably better to move on.  We moved on to… it was like an eight-mile day, like but it was like the hardest day I ever hiked.  We started off by… it’s like 2300 feet to… 7000 feet, then down to 6000 feet.  We’re hiking through snow at the end of it.  Long day.  Anyways, we showed up to Isaac Lake.  We sit down; we eat dinner; we go to bed, like pragmatic, just like… Trail crews get along best when they’re working hard.  Like construction crews hate each other because they look at each other all day.  Cut and run crews move and cover ground; they’re too tired to argue.  It’s a beautiful thing.  So, we were just reveling in that, that we were just too tired to argue with each other, and just, like timing was just impeccable.  It started to drip, drip, drip.  We were like oh, like, here comes rain.  Then the roll of thunder comes from the west.  We were like oh my God, here it comes.  Then… I can’t even… I wish I could draw… I can’t draw.  I don’t know.  Paint.  If I was artistic… I need to articulate this somehow, this camping at Isaac Lake that night, and then hearing the cells moving.  I said I was going to get out of my tent, but where do you go?  I’ve actually done research, because I’m afraid of lightning, and if I’m afraid of things, I research them, so I figured out… the literature… there’s no safe place outside.  So, like, I went to like a stand of trees which were all similar size, and I watched about a hundred yards away lightning strike trees and blowing up trees and this blue-green color… I’d never seen such crazy colors.  This was at… five cells came through.  They would last fifteen minutes.  A half-hour break, and another cell would come through.  Just a pattern of the onset of the cell was driving rain, hail, wind, sideways wind, and up-and-down wind.  Lightning every five seconds would be conservative, I think.  There was a lot of lightning.  It was like all of the pent-up energy from the whole season was just releasing in one storm.  I didn’t sleep very much that night.  Back to where this came from is the culture out there… usually we do check-ins at eight o’clock, but at six o’clock in the morning, we’re all… the ranger at Moose Creek was on radio, checking us, because she knew where we were, checking the other trail crew, but there was still no contact from Shissler Lookout.  We’re like, where is Laura?  What is she doing up there?  Finally, she gets on, and we’re like, Laura, how was your night up there?  She…</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Laura is the lookout?</p>
<p><strong>MB:</strong> Laura’s the lookout at Shissler, and she said that at nine pm, she got a call from Indian Hill Lookout, which is west of her, saying, Laura, get on your stool, turn off your radio.  Her stool has glass on it, and it’s insulated.  She said all of a sudden, sideways hail, driving wind.  She got on her stool, and her hair was standing on end, and she was watching… she had her azimuth in front of her, and she was watching electricity arc between everything, buzzing, Saint Elmo’s Fire, watching ground strikes, trying to write them, where they were.  She was smoking cigarettes, because she was trying to do anything to make herself relax.  This was all night.  She didn’t sleep at all until the morning.  But that was really cool to get on the radio and everyone was looking out.  Everyone was really worried.  Everyone was… because that was a hell of a storm.  People in Missoula saw it, and it was… I don’t know.  And the next morning everyone was hung over from thunder and lightning and not sleeping.  Even the animals were out, and it was such a weird day.  We decided then to call in that hitch a little early, and went back to the station for the Fourth of July.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, you do know where you were on Fourth of July?</p>
<p><strong>MB:</strong> Mmm-hmmm.  I DO know where I was on Fourth of July.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Wow, so, were you thinking, that’s going to be a lot of trail to clear?</p>
<p><strong>MB</strong>: Yeah.  But mostly I was just thinking about myself at that point.  It definitely was a paradigm shift.  Sitting in my tent, I was like do I really want to get out of my tent?  No, I don’t want to get out of my tent.  What are the odds of being struck by lightning?  Odds?  No idiot has been where I am right now.  There’s no way you can deduce odds.  I figured out that the odds are like 1 in 700,000 of being struck by lightning, but no one was camped basically in Isaac Lake, up at 6,000 feet in a lightning storm.  There’s no… So that was actually a really good thought.  It was a really good epiphany for me.  You know what?  No one’s been here.  And I’ve been in a lot of places where no one’s been.  And people have been in a lot of places where I haven’t been.  So the probability needs to be taken with a grain of salt.   Look where you are; don’t look at the numbers of what’s happened where you are.</p>

<strong>Interviewers:</strong> Debbie Lee and Jane Holman<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> May 6, 2011<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Nezperce, Idaho<br />
<strong>Topic:</strong> Education in Wilderness</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, Connie, how did you first come to this area, the Selway-Bitterroot area?</p>
<p><strong>CS:</strong> It was a big chance. I was living in Iowa, that’s where I was born, and I was in a workshop called American Wilderness Leadership School. Now Iowa is one of the six states that does not have wilderness so it’s pretty foreign to that part of the country although I was a rural person and grew up in the country and that’s why I learned to love the land. But I was in a Wilderness Leadership School and there was a young woman there, it was the very first one in Iowa as a matter of fact, there was a young woman there, Jill, and she had been a lookout at Powell Ranger Station because her brother had come out from Iowa and he was living in Lolo so she came out for a summer and worked at the Bear Mountain Lookout. You know Bear Mountain. And she had taken some photographs and she had those with her. She showed me these photographs and I was just overwhelmed, something went wang in my heart and it was I have to be in this place. Just right then: I have to go there. And I remember driving out of the driveway and I thought damn this is the stupidest thing you ever did, you better just turn around and go back to little Essex, Iowa, and not do this anymore and I almost turned around but I headed west. So I took my time driving along the way. I stopped at Cabellas. It’s back before Cabellas was the gigantic thing it is now. They only had two stories then. So I stopped and I spent a half a day at Cabellas buying a sleeping bag, a hat, and whatever I thought I needed. I wasn’t sure all the gear that you needed but I still sleep in that sleeping bag to this day. So I drove on out and I stayed in cheap motels a couple of nights along the way. I remember seeing an antelope give birth to a fawn I guess you call them along the way and I was just enjoying the scenery and I got to the summit between Montana and Idaho, you know, at the top and I got out of the pickup and I said here I am. I almost kissed the ground but I thought okay and then it said Clearwater National Forest and I said this is where I’m going to work. So my first 10-day hitch I went in with the pack string and even though I lived on a farm and had been around animals a lot I really wasn’t that familiar with mules, now we raise them. And I helped the packer get my stuff together and was just fascinated with the whole procedure of packing which I later learned to do myself to my amazement. And we were busy and he pointed up to the hills and he said see up there and I said yah. He says it’s snowing there. He said that’s where we’re going. Okay. One thing I do remember driving down the highway I was looking up into the hills, now this is really dumb, but it was so steep. It was just so steep and I thought well there’s no way you can get up in there. I didn’t know there were roads there. I didn’t know there were trails there. I thought where am I going to work. You can’t negotiate those hills. Now that’s pretty dumb. But there I was in the middle of them for several more years. So the packer put me on a big tall mule and we took off for Horse Camp which is about a 10 mile trip up Boulder Creek that drains into the Lochsa and there’s a little cabin back there called Horse Camp, see there’s a picture of it right there. That’s Horse Camp, yah. And he dumped me off and said I’ll see you in 10 days. So I said okay and I really didn’t have any direction or orientation into this job. So they dumped me off all by myself. I had a map and all of my hitches were by myself until I, I had never been there, of course, before so I had to just figure it out on my own and I probably learned things better by doing that than someone saying, leading me by the hand. I had some huge learning experiences that I obviously lived through but.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> That’s good. So how do your teaching and wilderness merge like for you? What’s the cross-over?</p>
<p><strong>CS:</strong> I think it was a natural thing because part of my job description was education which meant I was to make visitor contacts in the woods and I was to spread the message of low impact camping and to educate the public who used the wilderness about what wilderness really is and why we expect certain rules to be followed in the wilderness and part of it’s the philosophy of wilderness and part of it is the actual physical use of the wilderness and so it was my job to communicate that to the public.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> How, can you tell us a little bit about Reach a Teacher, Touch the World? Or did I get that?</p>
<p><strong>CS:</strong> That’s right. Reach a Teacher, Touch the World.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Because that’s pretty significant initiative that you had.</p>
<p><strong>CS:</strong> Yes, it was really satisfying. When I worked in Iowa as a teacher there was a stint there that I worked for the Department of Education in Iowa as the assistant to the environmental education director for the state and we taught environmental education or conservation education, I like to call it conservation education, a better choice of words I think. But we taught to teachers and showed them how to teach children about conservation education. While I was in that job I wrote a grant proposal for taking teachers to the wilderness and they would do actual work projects, clearing trail, rehabbing camp sites, and the list goes on but they would actually do physical labor in the woods. And then they would write curriculum while they were camped out there, they would get ideas about how they would use wilderness education in their classrooms. So it ran the gamut of art teachers, PE teachers, whatever, and they would come up with ideas about implementing wilderness education and either then or when they got back to the classroom in Iowa they would write a lesson plan and they submitted it to me and then they would report every few weeks as to the progress and accomplishments and then they would receive also college credit from the University of Northern Iowa for education. So it was a great project. There were wonderful teachers who came out. There were wonderful ideas that implemented wilderness education.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> That’s amazing. Do you remember any of the projects that the teachers came up with to take back to the classrooms? Like do any stick out in particular as being?</p>
<p><strong>CS:</strong> It’s been a long time ago. I remember an art teacher took photographs of the wilderness area and explained to her students what wilderness was and she had them create projects related to art. I remember a home ec teacher, she had her students make placemats that showed wilderness scenes and then she had projects in cooking, you know, with like back country cooking and whatever for her students.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> That’s awesome. So you, you were saying that you started out hiking alone and I know that you prefer that now. And some people might think a woman hiking alone how could you, like do you get frightened, how do you handle that? Not just as a woman but as a person just kind of the loneliness aspect of it?</p>
<p><strong>CS:</strong> I’m a loner by nature although I do like people. I enjoy being with people. I like being by myself a lot. That’s very important to me and I don’t think loneliness was so much a factor. I would see people occasionally passing by and whatever. Sometimes I would go four or five days without seeing someone. But the fearfulness I don’t remember really being afraid of anything. I’m a spiritual and faithful person and I kind of gave over my life to, you know, there’s God taking care of me and I know that but I did learn to, and I don’t remember being fearful. There was lightening storms and there were creek crossings and there were lots of challenging things physically but I’m naturally an impatient person and this taught me, since I was by myself, to be very careful about where you put your feet, you know, Connie if you get hurt here there’s no way anybody’s going to help you, you’re on your own. So it taught me to plan ahead about how I would negotiate this or that or how I would deal with the water supply or bee stings and that kind of thing. I just love being in that place so much. It just took care of me, you know. It’s a pretty overpowering feeling to look up into those hills and especially being a flatlander like I was. I still am in awe of the power of those mountains and the power of the weather and the creeks and just the sheer hugeness of it and the fact that we’re not in control of anything.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So you, even after you quit working officially for the Forest Service, you got right back involved in teaching and educating people how to work in the wilderness. Can you talk about what you do now with the interns and volunteers through the Selway-Bitterroot Foundation?</p>
<p><strong>CS:</strong> I had to get back. I couldn’t leave. I guess it might have been selfish on my part but I really believed in the Selway-Bitterroot Foundation. It began to be formed just as I was starting to end my career there so it overlapped. The Selway-Bitterroot Foundation was just getting on its feet and really in its infancy and so we had several projects going on. I think people didn’t realize how many projects we had before it really came into being as it is now. But we had many, many projects. And I was the only field leader then so I was still really busy in the woods with different projects and that made me happy because I got to be there. And then I got to help train the wilderness interns when Rob Mason came on board and really transformed the Selway-Bitterroot Frank Church Foundation into the organization that it’s becoming. I helped in getting that part going and then I’m in a limited capacity now. There’ll be a group from Iowa coming in July and I’ll be with them but it’s still an opportunity to expose other people to the wilderness and, you know, it’s kind of an, education kind of takes care of itself. If you can get them there, if you can get people to the wilderness they become advocates already. They understand, they get it. If you just get the people to that place then the rest of the work is done for you. It’s, I don’t, maybe not work but the education is done for you. They get it.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep10.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Download Podcast</a></p>"
sbw291,Women in Wilderness,"July 12, 2011",2011-07-12,Episode 9,sbw291.mp3,14:10,"In this episode, titled “Women in Wilderness,” we hear from Rachel Kaufman, a third generation Montanan, who grew up enjoying the recreational opportunities that wilderness offers.  Rachel graduated from the University of Montana with a B. S. in Natural Resource Conservation, and she has previously worked as a wilderness ranger in Washington’s Alpine Lakes Wilderness and on wilderness trail crews in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness and the Chugach National Forest in Alaska. Rachel decided that she had seen a lot of beautiful places, but nothing was quite like the mountains of Montana.  She also felt a little bit of ownership, and felt that she needed to come back and be a part of the conservation effort.  In 2010, Rachel got a job with the Bitterroot National Forest on a trail crew, and then from there, she started working for the Selway-Bitterroot Frank Church Foundation during the summer season.  As the SBFCF’s web site comments, “Her lively personality and enthusiasm for wilderness stewardship compliment Rachel’s strong wilderness background to make her an effective and engaging wilderness leader. She is thankful for this opportunity to give back to the wild places that she loves and respects so much.”",Rachel Kaufman,http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep9.mp3?_=6,Rachel

<p><strong>Interviewee</strong>: Rachel Kaufman<br />
<strong>Interviewer</strong>: Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: Missoula, Montana<br />
<strong>Date</strong>: April 20, 2011</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: That’s really cool. So, you wrote this article in, what was it?</p>
<p><strong>RK</strong>: Oh, the Bitterroot Star.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: The Bitterroot Star. Can you talk about the event that caused this article?</p>
<p><strong>RK</strong>: Yeah, so the Selway-Bitterroot Foundation and the Montana Wilderness Association kind of started this collaboration with the younger members of the Montana Wilderness Association called the Ridge Runners.  The idea was to do five to six volunteer projects – day-long volunteer trips – throughout the summer.  I had found the Blodgett Overlook Trail, which is this beautiful… it’s about a mile and a half long trail, and it goes up to overlook this iconic canyon in the Bitterroots, and there’s a beautiful overlook up to an arch…if you look south, there’s a natural rock arch, when you’re at the bridge, the stock bridge.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Yes, I was at the stock bridge.</p>
<p><strong>RK</strong>: Next time if you look south when you do it, there’s an archway.  Okay, so anyway, this is a different trail from the canyon trail.  My Montana… my Ridge Runner volunteers… it was two gals plus myself.  We went up to this trail.  It’s a very steep, switchbacking trail, and so trail users will often just cut off the switchbacks; they’ll often just go straight up the switchbacks, and that’s really detrimental to the soil and the ecology of that area.  It creates… water runs off a lot more quickly, and there’s… the erosion is immense, especially on this trail.  The erosion is immense, and the cutoffs between the switchbacks are five to fifteen feet in some places, because people are just going up and spreading their impact, and so it’s really a problem.  From there, weeds can infest, it’s bare, compacted soil so native plants aren’t going to seed there as easily as non-native plants and invasive weeds will come in, so the three of us were on a mission to do… we installed some signs, some that said please stay off these trails, there’s restoration in progress, and then a couple more that kind of explained why you shouldn’t cut off switchbacks.  Those reasons that I just explained about: the weeds and the erosion, etc.  We installed three signs.  It meant digging big holes, lugging up the lumber, that sort of thing.  Then, we also dragged branches and tree stumps and rocks, and whatever we could, and we chunked up the cutoffs with pulaskis and shovels, and then blocked off these cutoffs with major scary-looking pieces of wood, so hopefully the idea is that people will stay on the trail.  They won’t cut off those switchbacks, and I’m hoping that maybe actually in a couple of weeks to months I can go up and actually seed some native seeds up there.  That was part of my… if we chunk up the soil, we can get rid of some of the compaction that has occurred, and maybe seedlings – native seedlings – will take place.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Cool, cool.  So what’s it like to do a project with all women, and no testosterone on the trail?</p>
<p><strong>RK</strong>: It is really fun, actually.  The two gals that I was working with really stepped up, and I think when there’s… when males aren’t involved, I think females step up a little bit more.  I mean there’s always that strength and power there, but often the tendency or the habit to defer takes over, and without any males around, these two gals were hauling the biggest stumps around, and grunting and really feeling their female power.  That’s so fun for me to see, because often it’s suppressed.  This all-woman trio was great to work with.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Ah, so can you think of an example when it was suppressed that maybe you observed, or that you actually experienced?</p>
<p><strong>RK</strong>: Well, I know myself personally, I kind of… I’ve worked on all-male crews for a lot of years, and I’m torn in two different directions.  In one way, I’m definitely working to prove myself, and often over-exerting myself, but on the other hand, I guess I feel compelled to admit the fact that I’m not as physically strong to everybody.  That’s not necessarily that fun, but it’s also good to recognize, okay, well maybe I’m not as physically strong, but I know how to use teamwork and collaboration to accomplish the exact same thing, or my problem-solving skills might be more tuned because I can’t just use brute force, and that sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Have you met any women on the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness area that you maybe look up to as a role model?</p>
<p><strong>RK</strong>: Definitely.  Yeah, there’s… I worked with a gal with the Forest Service who –she was also on my crew – and she’d been doing trail crew type things for ten years, and she had an amazing eye for how to use a crosscut, and how to use the crosscut with the least amount of effort to make the most efficient cuts, and she knew so much about the trade, it was amazing.  There were some other women on the national forest who were wilderness rangers, and the wilderness manager there, they’re all good horsemen, good backcountry stewards, awesome with teaching people how to do Leave No Trace, and that sort of thing, so I definitely have quite a few role models, well, I guess three or four.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: That’s cool.  Now, you have taken a couple of solo trips, or?  Can you talk about hiking solo, because I know some people are afraid to hike solo, especially women, so can you talk about one or two of those trips?</p>
<p><strong>RK</strong>: Yeah, so I’ve done… this past fall, I was doing some work for the Forest Service, where they’d had a wilderness ranger who was gone, and he was… his workload needed to be done, so they asked me to do it, and so I did that through the Foundation, and it involved inspecting some outfitter camps.  It was in the fall, and so these outfitters had set up their camps, and they need to follow certain regulations in the wilderness that have to do with impact, and usage, and that sort of thing.  So there was a whole system of checking off if they’re doing the right sorts of things.   This was actually in the Frank Church Wilderness, the River of No Return Wilderness.  So, I was hiking maybe fifteen miles a day to get to these remote campsites, and I was doing it by myself, and it’s interesting.  I’ve done some hiking by myself for shorter periods of time, but these were five to six days in some cases, which is really an interesting opportunity to be reflective.  That’s one thing.  I definitely do some things different when I’m backpacking by myself.  One of those is that I bring a little mp3 player, because I am a little bit scared of the noises that go bump in the night.  When I’m trying to fall asleep, earplugs don’t necessarily cut it, and so I’d like to listen to the music to help me fall asleep.  In the past, I think like when I was 18 or 19, I would have completely pooh-poohed that idea.  I would have been: you can’t bring something like that into the wilderness, or even into the outdoors, just enjoy the noises, but I’d had enough sleepless nights, that I was just kind of resigned to the mp3 player, and in fact, I discovered that it was sort of nice to hike to, actually.  It had an external speaker, so I could, when I was feeling a little bit lonely, or had a song stuck in my head that I was tired of, because that happens when you’re by yourself, you just get one line over and over from the most annoying song you can imagine, and so, it served to eradicate the annoying song.  I had some kind of creepy experiences.  I was never really necessarily scared.  You get into your routines when you’re by yourself, which is very interesting.  You kind of have to remember to take time, and not do it all at once, because it’s very easy to get done hiking, cook your dinner, and then crawl into bed.  But then you’re in bed at 4:00, or 5:30 or whatever.  6:00 maybe.  So, I really enjoyed finding ways to not rush through the things that you’re used to doing, like cooking, and setting up your tent and going to bed.  I took a lot of walks in kind of the evening time.  When you’re with someone, you might be sitting around the campfire, or you might be socializing someway.  In this case, I was kind of exploring the campsite a little bit more.  That evening, I awoke to a tree falling.  I awoke to the crash of a tree falling.  So, that was… I always, when I’m setting up a camp, look, because I’ve mentioned before, I’ve had a tree fall in the middle of the campsite before.  That was another moment where you’re like Holy Crap, but you can’t really say it to anyone, so you just lay awake instead.  </p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: When you made your solo trip to Tin Cup and Kerlee, you encountered a cabin, or not? What happened there?</p>
<p><strong>RK</strong>: Right, so this was a campsite monitoring trip that I went on, and I take photocopies of past inventories that wilderness rangers have made from the seventies on, to kind of help me as a rubric.  Well, what was it… what did it look like five years ago?  The campsites are supposed to be monitored every five years.  What am I looking for, what landmarks am I looking for, how do I find this campsite, and then, I’ll make a little map of it, and so one of the campsites that I was looking for, the inventory described it as being a ways off the trail, following a little social trail, and there would be the remains of a cabin there.  Or there was a cabin there, I think is what it said, something along those lines.  I just spent a ton of time looking for it.  I really wanted to see this old cabin, and I never found it. I didn’t find a trail; I didn’t find the remains… nothing like that.  But I got back, and I talked to the wilderness ranger who’d actually written up this old inventory, and she said, well, you know this cabin actually was built by the Kerlee family.  The Kerlee family is… I mean this is Kerlee Creek, Kerlee Lake, and now there’s this… I didn’t know that there was a Kerlee family who had a cabin, and so that was very interesting.  She said up until around 10 or 15 years ago, the cabin was being used by the Kerlee family, and at some point that use came to an end.  She and her co-worker went and dismantled and burned the cabin.  So, this was just an example of how recent history can be.  I was actually pretty disappointed that I hadn’t been able to find the remains of the cabin, and see what someone had built back in the forest.  But very interesting.  She also told me that the Kerlee family still lives in the valley.  Are still alive.  So it’s living history.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Yes!  That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>RK</strong>: It’s very cool.  History can be last year, even.  It still has that impact on you.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Yeah, that’s right.<br />

<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Dick Walker<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Moscow, Idaho<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> March 7, 2011<br />
<strong>Topic:</strong> Wilderness Photography</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Could you talk a little bit about how you got interested in photographing images and turning them into artwork?</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> I think at first, it was the objective was to document. And it was a little later, I remember going to a… taking leave and going to an Ansel Adams presentation at WSU. I remember, I got there early, and it was in one of the auditoriums, and Ansel came in, and sat down midway down on the left side, and I went up and introduced myself, and when I reached out to shake his hand, he withdrew his hand, and he said, gently. Man, he said, I’ve got arthritis. It wasn’t until just recently that I understood what the hell he was talking about. Because I’m starting to get that affliction myself. So I… but anyway, that was my first… I never got to attend one of his workshops. This was as close as I got. It was at that point… he was using a 35mm KodaChromes for his presentation. And, you know all of his primary work was 8&#215;10 format negative camera, black and white, primarily. He did some Polaroid work, later on. I guess maybe that’s where it first… Like Wallace Stegner… you were doing more than documenting. You were trying to capture a sense of place. Which Ansel did very well. So did so many of those early photographers, with the F64 Club, or whatever, where they were shooting for maximum depth-of-field. But anyway, that’s…</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> There’s one photo in particular, a set of photos, “A Remnant of What Once Was,” and I know that they took place in 2001, and they’re based on an experience you had with Sarah Walker. Can you just tell us about that experience, and how you happened upon that scene, and kind of tell the story of that?</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> There were a number of sequences, but I think the one that you’re referring to was… Early that spring…</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> What spring? 2001?</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> 2001. There was a tremendous, totally abnormal, in contemporary terms, flush of spring Chinook salmon. Coming up the Snake and in the Clearwater, and that was the first spring Chinook salmon I had ever caught. I was with Steve Pettit, a close friend. We caught these spring Chinook, and of course, you could keep them, and these were hatchery fish; they did not have the adipose. Then, later that year, Sarah and I flew in, and we were on up this major drainage that flows into the Selway, and I had first been on that drainage the fall of 1969, and I was heading up toward the Montana border, and I’d seen this set of pools. I even took a photograph or two, and it was a beautiful place, pictorially, but when Sarah and I were up there, the place was filled with these giant spring Chinook salmon. Now, these are salmon that are like, 2 ½ to almost 4 feet long. I mean they all had their adipose fin. These were wild. These were a remnant, truly, of what once was, and this is probably the most intact hydrologic watershed left in the, at least the anadromous fisheries part of the Pacific Northwest. So, it’s not a question of will the habitat support the fish; it’s the friggin’ dams that are screwing up the fish. It’s not the habitat, the lack of habitat. There was one fish that I called Whitey; there’s… I don’t know the correct terminology, Steve can clarify that, but when the fish are going downstream in the spring of the year, when they go over the dams, they get something called nitrogen fixation, or something. They’re affected at that point in time, but it doesn’t raise hell with them until two or three or four years later, when they head back up into the fresh water. When they first enter the fresh water, then they start losing big patches of skin, and stuff. Whitey had lost all of the skin and the eyes on his head, and how in the hell that fish got all the way up through all those major rapids, including Selway Falls, and then all the way up the Selway… I mean it did it by scent, and something that… hell, we can’t even relate to. But it made it there. I have close-up photos of that, because it couldn’t see me, and I’ve got photos where it was only six feet away, where it was swimming totally oblivious to me, but it knew… it was waiting.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> I know that you have a tremendous collection of historical papers and photographs. How did you get interested in the history of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, and are there any historical stories that particularly stick with you as being really important?</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> I guess, initially, the history of the place didn’t have very much import or meaning to me. I was more interested in the physicality of it. My comparison was with the Rawah, which I had only made a fall trip into. In the Mount Zirkel Wilderness, there were a number of old mining claims and stuff, so, you know that… you couldn’t go buy an old mine and not realize that something had gone on there. Well, in the Selway, you didn’t have those kinds of physical impacts, and two years before I came in, the forest Service had purchased a… what was called at that time, Moose Creek Ranches. It was a complex of, I believe, about seven homesteads up there. Anyway, the structures that were on those places either had been burned incidentally or on purpose. All except for a few that weren’t right in your face, so to speak. Either the Forest Service people didn’t know they were there, or they didn’t pose that much of an assumed dilemma with the wilderness resource. Anyway, the more field trips I went on, the more I began seeing blazes that were not Forest Service, not the heel-toe Forest Service blaze. These blazes might be, rather than four or five feet above ground level, they might be ten or maybe fifteen feet up above ground level, and there’d be these notches cut in the trees, and if the tree was a green tree, this… what had been a layer, a martin set cut in with a notch, so it was like an undercut on a tree you were getting ready to fell, or fall, the top of the arch on a green tree, it sort of rounded over, so it looked like a cathedral arch, and I was wondering what in the hell are these cathedral arches? I’d follow this… so I’d get off the Forest Service trail, and I’d be following… most of these were along a ridgeline. Then they’d drop down so… and usually where they’d drop down you’d find either a cabin, or the remnants of a cabin. So these were the old trap lines, and stuff. So, that was my first… that was my teaser. I began looking more, and more, and more. I remember my first encounter with Jimmy Renshaw. I had come up from Barren Hill, and was walking up Wounded Doe Ridge, and of course the trail then, it was not a mainline trail. In fact, some places, when you’re going through the… hell, I can’t remember what… the ferns. The bracken fern. Big, heavy feel. You could feel the trail with your feet. You couldn’t see it, because the bracken fern was so frigging thick. So you’d go along the trails, feeling the tread with your feet. Anyway, I was around Tribulation Saddle, some place like that, and I saw some stock, and I went down and traced down the brand, and so on, and a couple of days later, when I got to Fish Lake, and I was going up behind Fish Lake, well, I came on to this camp, and this Jimmy Renshaw fellow was there. He mentioned… I remember him saying something like that… well, I wondered whose man-sign I saw. So, I knew I was talking to somebody who had his feet on the ground, and his eyes open. Jimmy was the first person that told me about the possibility of Hudson Bay Cabin being downstream and above the meadow complex at Fish Lake, there. I remember seeing the trail and this cabin early on, and it had a stone fireplace in it, so I knew it was an old, old cabin. There was another cabin that was down on the… below the trail toward the meadow complex, there. It had a puncheon roof, and you could see along the edge where they had dug out the earth right along the edge of the cabin and covered the roof for insulation. Of course that made it so that the roof was one of the first things to rot on this cabin as the years… I took some core samples of the Lodgepole Pine right there, and I don’t remember, they were around fifty years old or so, so anyway that cabin was somewhere between sixty-five, seventy years old or older.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> And this was in 19-?</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> That would have been probably ’70. ’69 or ’70 would be my guess. Somebody like Jim knew the country. Or somebody like Arnold Oswald, or Punk Wolfinbarger, those individuals knew segments of that country much deeper than any of the rest of us will ever know.</p>

Ed holds a degree from the University of Montana in Range Management Forestry, and started out as a forester in the Beaverhead Forest in southwestern Montana; from there he worked as District Ranger on both the Custer and the Gallatin Forests in Montana. His work with the Regional Wilderness Staff in writing Wilderness Act Guidelines then led him to the Bitterroot Forest as Wilderness Staff Officer. He was later promoted to Regional Wilderness and Wild River Staff Officer in the Southern Region, Atlanta, Georgia, where he led numerous Wilderness, Wild River, and Trail Training sessions. He eventually served as the Director of Wilderness for the entire United States, based in Washington DC, where he spread the Wilderness Act’s Philosophy of wilderness as a natural resource to areas all over the country.

Because of his experience as a smoke jumper, a river runner, and his knowledge of recreational and resource management, Ed joined and led teams in crafting the first wilderness management plans for wild river use, natural fire use and wilderness resource management in the Selway-Bitterroot that set the standard for wilderness management all over the United States. Today, Ed is still active in helping to raise awareness of wilderness issues, and write bills that further wilderness preservation.

<strong>Interview with</strong>: Ed Bloedel<br />
<strong>Interviewers</strong>: Debbie Lee<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: Corvallis, Montana (right outside of Hamilton)<br />
<strong>Date</strong>: April 18, 2011<br />
<strong>TOPIC</strong>: Implementation of the Wilderness Act of 1964</p>
<p><strong>EB</strong>: &#8230;The wilderness, of course, had been established for a long time, but they never really had a specific plan of how we were going to try to manage it. It was after a Region 1 workshop that told us… that we sat together and worked, instructed by Bill Warf as the recreation staff officer, and others what wilderness was like, and what it was about, and then our studies. We said well, it’s time we should put together a plan for this. There was overuse up around Big Creek Lake, up around the popular lakes back in here on the west side, coming out of Hamilton, so it was time to figure out what to do. So we began to prepare a plan. In those days, we thought it would be a good idea if we involved the people, because there was a lot of people interested in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness. Outfitters, and besides them a lot of individuals that live here in the valley, or that come from all over Montana just to work their way back in there. So, we had a list of, I don’t know, 2-300 different people and agencies and all the county officers and the state officers, and even the congressional delegation. Max Baucus was on board then, too. He was kind of a young senator then. It was in 1975. ’74 and ’75 when we were working on that. He’s still a senator. So we started to write the plan, and by gathering the people together, and telling what some of the problems were, and what the situation was, and how… and then asking, how do you think we should manage this area and still keep it as wild as possible? So we set up little tables and had group discussion, and then they’d bring back their report, and we’d put those reports together, and we had help, of course, with the coordinating people that know how to do that sort of thing. Then we prepared the plan, and finally put it in place.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: So do you remember any specific struggles or controversies or “aha” moments that happened during that process?</p>
<p><strong>EB</strong>: Yeah, let me give you a specific… Two ladies – two of my favorite ladies here; I think they may have passed now – in the Bitterroot, wrote me a letter one time during the process. It was just after or just before, I can’t remember, we made the plan. Said they were walking up Sawtooth Creek and the log was gone that they normally cross. So they had to cross the stream early in the spring. They didn’t make it. They fell down, and they got wet, and they wrote me… it’s hilarious little story about how in the wilderness, couldn’t you at least replace a log, you know, as a bridge. They wrote it to the Forest Service, and of course the wilderness staff officer gets to answer for the Forest Supervisor, write his letter back. So I wrote them one back, and told them how wonderful a wilderness experience they had, and I don’t think we will be replacing that bridge. It should stay wild. We had a good conversation after that. Eventually, we put another log across there, a single log bridge, because in the spring time, the water is so swift, it’s very difficult to get across.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: That’s a great story. So, that must have involved a lot of different people’s idea about what wilderness was, especially so soon after the Wilderness Act was passed.</p>
<p><strong>EB</strong>: Oh, I’ll say.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: How did you navigate that, and how has your own definition of wilderness changed through that process and through the years?</p>
<p><strong>EB</strong>: It never changed, except to get stronger through the years. You see, my career after here, I went to the Region 8 and I was the wilderness and trails and river specialist there for that whole region: southeast region. Then I went from there into Washington offices, the wilderness specialist for the chief. In those days, I began to… before I went there, though, I had the philosophy of what wilderness was about based on the law. By taking the law itself, where it says specifically, this is what wilderness is, it’s defined, it starts right out in the first… right under the preamble. In order to prevent all of this development, and everything being developed, where Congress established an enduring resource of wilderness. And right from there, “an enduring resource of wilderness” set up the philosophy. The philosophy is that wilderness is a resource in itself, and it’s defined by the parts of the wilderness act that say there’ll be no buildings, no roads, the least amount of civilization as possible, natural conditions will continue to take place. Other things can take place in wilderness, like recreation use, fishing and hunting, but the primary purpose is to preserve the wilderness as a resource, and it stays wild. Always. So that philosophy was crammed… was jammed into me from Bill Warf and some others that were leaders in Region 1 at the time. Region 1 put together the first workshop for all us… in fact, I have to back up a little bit, here. I got that philosophy earlier than before I started working here, on the Selway-Bitterroot. I was a ranger at the time we developed this philosophy in Region 1 over on the Gallatin on the Gallatin Ranger District. It’s now combined into two ranger districts. At that time it was called Squaw Creek ranger district. The Spanish Peaks wilderness was on our district. We had a workshop here, when I was there in 1966-1972, sometime during that period was when the region had its first workshop in how to manage wilderness and how to put together this philosophy as to how… as to making it a basic resource, and a wild resource, and keeping it that way. So I was all worked up with that, by the time I got the job over here. I’d gone through a range job and the regional office, and a job out here. In fact, we had, when I was there in that ranger district, all the rangers in Region 1 that had wilderness, and all the resource assistants that had wilderness, and a lot of the wilderness rangers that were operating, still working during that period of time when we had that spring workshop, like Dick Walker, and others that have been a long time with us. That’s where I developed the philosophy and strength and the understanding of the wilderness resource, and it’s all based on the Act, and it’s based on a strict interpretation of the Act, instead of looking in the Act for where the exceptions are, and what you might get away with, and how you can manage it, you look for how you can keep it as wild as possible. When you have that philosophy, there’s no problem in working with some of the exceptions if you have, to, but the basic philosophy is the protection of the wilderness resource, and keeping it intact. So, I had that, and so I brought that over here when I came. I started to say, about that time, we were also having… we had fifteen, or eighteen I guess, new outfitter applications to float the wild Selway River. So, we sat down with the Moose Creek district ranger and the recreation staff officer over there on the Nez Perce, because the river’s both on the Bitterroot Forest and on the Nez Perce. We sat down together and we said, we gotta do something about this. Of course, by that time, I’d floated the river a couple of times, and I understood how wild it was. The ranger, Dean Burn at the West Fork, and myself, and these resource assistants said, all of these guys are applying, but they’re not here yet. There’s four of them that are here now. Let’s leave it at four. Let’s start with that. Let’s allow the public to start building their own use, without having to come through an outfitter. So we set four… we established in the plan the four outfitters, and their four… I think it was four launches apiece throughout the very short season in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness—in the Selway River. The rest of the days, which was the majority of them, to be open for drawing to float the river. Well, we had a massive amount of applications for the drawing, even right from the start. You know, the philosophy of outfitting guiding is: outfit and guides are there to help people be able to use wilderness or enjoy the wilderness of enjoy some other countryside, hunting, whatever. When there’s not enough people already getting there, or when it’s too difficult for them, long distances, or too much equipment, you can’t afford all the equipment, and all that sort of thing. Well, there was plenty of people that could afford the equipment and wanted to float the river, so we felt that we’d have a river… As long as there was a river there with all those other people, thousands of people floating… As long as there was a river in the National Park service with motorboats floating down through the Grand Canyon; we talked to those people. We did talk to different people when we were writing this plan, and the difficulty they were having in trying to reduce the amount of use, and the noise with the motor boats and other stuff in their wilderness, in the Grand Canyon… Why not create a wilderness river that’s really a wilderness river? We’d just have one launch a day, let the people camp wherever they want, let them stay as long as they want, but not let it get crowded. And that was our philosophy, and that’s why we wrote that plan as strictly as we did.</p>

<p><strong>Interview with</strong>: Rob Mason<br />
<strong>Interviewers</strong>: Debbie Lee and Jane Holman<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: Moscow Idaho<br />
<strong>Date</strong>: March 5, 2011</p>
<p><strong>RM</strong>: So, eventually I did apply for the position and I was lucky enough to get to work for the Selway-Bitterroot Foundation, and that&#8217;s how I got up here in the nonprofit sector working in the Selway.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: So when you say take care of the places what does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>RM</strong>: Well, the Wilderness Act defines sort of broadly what it means to steward a wilderness area, and basically what it says is to protect wilderness character… the number one job of all the agencies when it comes to wilderness is to protect wilderness character. So, it&#8217;s kind of a vague term, “wilderness character.” It’s been defined by agencies, but in general you can say it means do it whatever you need to do to make sure this place stays wild, natural, undeveloped, untrammeled… has solitude and those kind of qualities. So that&#8217;s kind of what to me taking care of a place means. Protecting the wilderness character of it. And how that plays out in the field is in any number of ways. Of course things as basic as opening trails, to invasive weed management, recreation management, regulations to protect solitude if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: So what are some of the… Do you have any experiences of experiencing solitude in the wilderness that particularly inform your idea about it?</p>
<p><strong>RM</strong>: Solitude is probably the one of the trickiest things to try to manage for in the wilderness, because it&#8217;s so because it means so many different things to so many different people. When I worked in the Sierras, if you only saw 20 people in a day, that was solitude to me, because it was so crowded there. For someone coming up from LA, if they were camped at a lake with 100 people, that was solitude because it was so remote compared to where they live. Up here, if you see two people in a day, you&#8217;re like, wow, that was amazing. We got to talk to some people today besides our crew. And usually, that&#8217;s not what happens. Usually, you don&#8217;t see anyone a lot of times, besides your crew. So it’s a tricky thing… it’s a social science really, solitude is. I am not a social scientist. But that&#8217;s a hard one to define. For me, with the background that I have…</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: And you personally. Can you… if someone said, well, give me an example of when you personally experienced it, what would be your example?</p>
<p><strong>RM</strong>: Well, I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to be in a lot of wilderness areas in my life. I will say that the Selway is unquestionably the wildest place, and part of that is because of the tremendous solitude. For me, part of solitude is also… I experience it most intensely when there&#8217;s also sort of a fear factor I guess would be the right word? When you don&#8217;t really know what the outcome’s going to be. There is a risk you&#8217;re taking and you’re by yourself. I have really never experienced that as intensely anywhere else as I have in the Selway because you&#8217;re so far away from anything when you’re solo backpacking through the Selway, and if you don&#8217;t have a radio with you, which often times you don’t necessarily if you’re a member of the public, and even if we’re not on work time. You experience it to a high degree.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: So, when you first came into the wilderness, you say you&#8217;ve been a lot of wilderness areas, you&#8217;ve been lucky enough… When you first came into the Selway-Bitterroot country, what was different about the place, I mean obviously you said the remoteness and the lack of people, but is there anything peculiar or odd or… that struck you?</p>
<p><strong>RM</strong>: The thing that makes the Selway special is it… I guess I didn&#8217;t realize this to the full extent that I feel like I do now when I came here, but it is super wild. I mean it is what wilderness… the epitome of wilderness to me. A wildness, I guess, and it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s so big and there are so few intrusions from the outside so… and contrast a place like Death Valley which is a lot of wilderness has a lot of roads cutting up into it.. I mean cherry stemming into the wilderness boundaries. The Selway doesn&#8217;t, and so it’s this big contiguous block, and also the populations around it are low, and so you don&#8217;t get that many people there, and it&#8217;s so rugged I mean it&#8217;s unquestionably the most rugged place I&#8217;ve ever been. I mean more rugged than the Olympic peninsula to me, far more rugged than the Sierras or the Southern Rockies, and that makes it hard to get around, so all of that collectively makes it incredibly wild, and that&#8217;s what really strikes me about the Selway. It&#8217;s not spectacular scenery, although it is beautiful, but it is wild.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Right, and it has to grow on you.</p>
<p><strong>RM</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Yeah. So what… can you tell us about one of your most… maybe one trip in particular that was memorable to you?</p>
<p><strong>RM</strong>: I decided one day to hike in to Moose Creek in a day from Paradise. This was in my off time; I just wanted to go visit some folks at Moose Creek, and I decided… I knew there were some beds back there, and I think I had left a sleeping bag there and a tent, so I didn’t really need overnight stuff. So I was like, all right. I’m just going to move light and fast. I’m going to wear tennis shoes. I’m going to take a little day pack and I’m just going to go. Thirty miles or something like that. Well, that part of the Selway trail is way more rocky than the downstream part of the Selway trail, below Moose Creek. It was a huge mistake. By about halfway through, you know, a thirty mile hike is never easy no matter where you are, even if it’s flat dirt. But my feet were just in horrible pain. I felt like I could barely walk. I tried to stop in at Selway Lodge for a break and no one was there, so I just kept moving through. But I didn’t have any stuff to… I couldn’t stop. Because I didn’t have any stuff with me. I mean I would have had to basically cover myself in leaves if I wanted to spend the night somewhere. I had no food. I mean I had some snacks, but it was just horrible. I couldn’t really walk the next day, both from blisters, and from, just fatigue. That was one of the memorable trips. I’ll never do that again.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Okay. So, what do you see in terms of wilderness and the wilderness preservation system throughout North America and why is the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness important in the larger system in terms of the country, and maybe even the world?</p>
<p><strong>RM</strong>: The Selway is the third largest wilderness area today in the lower 48 states. It’s right adjacent to the Frank, which you could argue is the first or second largest wilderness area, depending how people define Death Valley, which would rival it. I guess the Selway is a flagship in the National Wilderness Preservation System because of its size and its complexity. It sets a lot of examples of what should happen in a lot of other places around the country. For example, wildfire policy, or wilderness wildfire policy. The Selway was sort of the testing grounds, and it could be the testing grounds because it was so big and remote, and you could let a fire rip and it wasn’t going to burn down a community somewhere. I guess on a broader sense, I think the Selway is important for the country because it says something when a country says, we’re going to set aside a chunk of land, and a huge chunk of land that actually does have a lot of resources that could be used for human uses, extractive uses, but we’re not going to do that. We’re going to set it aside for all of the values we know wilderness has. That’s powerful, and I think it opens the door for allowing that to happen in other places, both in this country and in other countries, really. So to me, the Selway is incredibly valuable for those two reasons, and I’m sure we could list a million others.</p>","Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-ep6.mp3"">Download Podcast</a></p>"

TOPIC: Whitewater on the Selway River</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Okay Jerry, so, tell us a little bit about your background, and then maybe go to how you got connected with the Selway River.</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: Sure. I was born in 1947, in southern Idaho. My family extended family were farm families, and my mother was a school teacher my dad worked in agriculture, and I was raised in Hazelton, Idaho. As a young kid I was watching a TV show that showed Don Smith riding a raft down the Middle Fork. I announced to my mother and my big sister, Roberta, that I was going to do that. Roberta, of course, laughed at me and made fun of me and we got in a fight. The summer of ’67, I got a job guiding for Hatch River Expeditions. That&#8217;s the summer that Bus Hatch passed away and his sons Don and Ted took over the business. I worked for Don and Ted for seven summers from 1967 through ‘73 while I was going to college and law school at University of Idaho. The way I got up to the Selway was kind of blind luck. ‘67 was the first year the Hatch, or really any of the river companies actually showed up and took people down the Selway River. The Hatch boats were old military surplus 10-mans. So down the river we went on extraordinarily low water. I never ran the Selway lower in the years that I worked there, than on that first trip. We had seven days, because Don wanted to make sure we could make our way down the river slowly, and scout, and take our time. I remember really having to push the boats until we made it down through the first couple of days. We were stuck in the rocks almost constantly, but we had a great trip. Some of my memories of that trip were: I&#8217;d never seen rattlesnakes that short and that fat, and they were everywhere it seems like especially on the upper river. That was the first time I&#8217;ve ever personally guided with Don, and Don and I really hit it off, and we became great friends. I got to boat several times with Don on the Selway in later years. We finished the trip up, and Don just felt like he had gone to heaven. He loved the Selway. He&#8217;d always been a Middle Fork guy. He loved the Middle Fork, and he loved the Green River and Lodore, kind of small rocky rivers. But the Selway instantly became his favorite river. It was neat to go with Don Hatch, because the guy was undoubtedly the best boatman I ever followed in my life. Don would just sit on his boat and it would go where it was supposed to go without any oar strokes, and the rest of us would be following along behind him, rowing back and forth, and spinning around, and doing spins. Don Hatch was just such a gentleman. He always was so proper. He always combed his hair, and he wore an Oxford button down shirt with Levi blue jeans and high top Chuck Taylors and was just quite a gentleman, and he loved to camp cook I got to really kind of learn how to be a river camp cook working with Don on those early trips.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: So how was the Selway… you said that Don Hatch… that was his favorite river. How was the Selway different from some of the other rivers you&#8217;ve run?</p>
<p><strong>JH</strong>: I&#8217;m sure the reason Don liked it was: it’s very technically difficult. On the flows that we used to run. We you always used to run medium water down through medium-low water. That water condition on the Selway means it&#8217;s a Boatman’s river. You&#8217;re dodging around, and having to make tight fits through rocks, and there’s a steep gradient, so you always have something going on. You don&#8217;t just sit on the boats and cruise through flat water; you&#8217;re always busy. The rapids… the other fun thing is the rapids really change. They&#8217;re extremely tight and technical on the upper end of the river, and then by the time you&#8217;re down below Moose Creek, you’ve got enough volume that you’re starting to get some real punch to the river, from increased volume. It’s the style of river that Idaho boatmen absolutely love. It’s busy and tricky all the way. Also, Don loved the cool weather. He loved pine trees. He loved the crystal-clear water. I think probably the signature deal of the Middle Fork and the Selway has to be that crystal-clear water, which you don’t find anywhere else, that I know of in the boating world. The Selway and the Middle Fork of the Salmon are just extraordinary for that. We would come back and run the Selway once or twice, occasionally three times a summer during the rest of the years that I was there with Hatch. During the seven years I worked for Hatch, I think we missed one or two years due to high water or no reservations, but I managed to do the first nine trips that Hatch did on the Selway during those seven years. I just loved it… well, Wolf Creek was the most dramatic drop by far, and then probably most difficult rapid would be Osprey and Ladle. I&#8217;ve never been in there on high water because Don was so cautious about high water in the days that I worked for him. So, I&#8217;ve never seen Moose Juice where it really takes off, and you get all the flow out of Moose Creek, but my friends like Mel and Larry, and the guys that worked for Don; they gradually boated higher and higher water. They were able to deal with it. But I guess that thing becomes almost a continuous class four plus rapid, as the water goes up double drop, and Ladle, Little Niagara, all that stuff, and they just run together and so it must be really impressive. I have not seen it on the higher flows. I only ran relatively modest flows. In fact one of the fun little water stories about working for Don, was my last year: ’73, which was a low-water year across Idaho. We had three Selway trips planned. I got to go on all three; but the last trip that I went on the Selway when I guided for Don was ’73, and we flew into the Running Creek Ranch to launch. Which is kind of a fun little twist, and I think I’ve understood that they decided they didn&#8217;t want that air traffic, and so they didn&#8217;t do that often if at all in the future after that. The Selway was just so extraordinary. We were just so excited to have the opportunity to boat it. We realized that hardly anybody was getting to boat it. Yet, looking back on it, even though we valued that time on the river so much, I don’t think we probably even properly valued the fact that we were there really early on, and that we got the chance to do what we did. One of the interesting things I remember is, river camping was so primitive in those days. Of course, people just went out and went to the bathroom anywhere they could, and we had a shovel and you were supposed to cover things up, but we used to bury our garbage. Then we’d come back to the camp the next week or the next year, and all the garbage would be dug up, of course. A bear would have gotten into it. We were really surprised at that. We thought, oh, wonder why that happened. Talk about not thinking ahead. Within those early years, working in Idaho, the Forest Service, especially on the Middle Fork, told us, hey, it’s time to start carrying out garbage, and I think all the river guides’ reaction was, we can’t possibly do that. Well, now, of course, we’re not only carrying out garbage, but we’re usually using fire pans and carry-out toilets, and the river thing has changed so dramatically. The river camps are so much better for it. Those early days were kind of interesting.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-5.mp3"">Download Podcast</a></p>

TOPIC: Communities of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, part 2</p>
<p><strong>EM</strong>: For someone like me, I have fun doing anything, like cutting a tree is fun for me, you know.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: So why is cutting a tree fun for you?</p>
<p><strong>EM</strong>: Because it’s a challenge. Because it’s a small puzzle. You’re using these “primitive” as they call them, as they’ve classified them, tools, and you’re using manual labor in a non-mechanical way, to remove these trees that weigh X amount of pounds, I mean hundreds and hundreds of pounds. If you don’t do something right, you have the risk of serious injury. You have the risk of damaging a priceless tool. You have the risk of damaging the trail even further, of creating more degradation to the trail. So it’s all – the whole thing – when you come up on a tree, and realize, thinking through what’s going to happen, looking through it as a… analyzing it critically and where you’re going to put your cuts, the most efficient way of getting that tree off of there. If it’s a big tree, you know, putting rollers underneath it or doing something that makes it just a little bit easier. Just the whole essence of trail clearing and crosscutting trees, I love it. It’s great.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: You’ve met some interesting people on the trail, and I know you helped in the rescue of a missing person. Do you want to tell us about that?</p>
<p><strong>EM</strong>: Yeah. It was my intern year and we had just got finished with our wilderness training. Our field training with Rob. We had taken time off. We were in Moose Creek for a full hitch doing trail clearing techniques and talking about the management plan and the opportunity classes, the administrative side… the whole nine yards of the in-depth field learning aspect. We were just leaving – it was the first day – we were leaving Moose Creek with a full trail crew. We had seven, eight… eight or nine people? I think three or four crosscut saws, full trail-opening kits. People have shovels and axes and Pulaskis and picks hanging off their backpacks. We’re fully loaded, we’re going out, we’re doing fifteen miles that day, going up East Moose, up the 421 trail. We’re going to go camp at Elbow Bend. And the goal was to cut out the East Fork of Moose Creek all the way to the Clearwater boundary. So we’re on the move and we’re only, maybe, four or five miles from the ranger station at Moose Creek, going up the 421 East Moose trail. We’re in the Three Forks area, previously known as the Moose Ranches area. We’re in the meadow, and we’re going up towards that outfitter camp there, and there’s a gentleman on the trail heading south toward Moose Creek. He has a fishing pole and a walking stick and he’s wearing army fatigue rain gear. Here I am, I’m in the front of the pack and I’m like, hey what’s going on, how’s the fishing? I see his fishing pole and He says, yeah, well, I haven’t been able to catch anything, so I’ve been eating bugs and berries for the last eight days, and he asks us how far is a road? And here we are in the heart of a 1.3 million acre wilderness area and we are right in the center of it. And we think he’s kind of joking and we’re like, you know, the closest road is probably thirty miles from here and he just gives like a solemn nod, okay. And he plans on keep going. We stopped and he said well, what’s up with all the planes flying overhead and we were like, oh, well, there’s a ranger station, and he was like thank God. Like, I’ve made it. Now we start questioning him and we’re like what has been going on and he tells us that he’s been – that he got turned around up at Diablo Peak up in the Elk Summit area. He went in Elk Summit and he had enough food for two days. He was backpacking; he was on a short weekend trip. He had enough food for two days; he had a backpack with him at that time but decided that after he got turned around and lost the trail that the backpack was too heavy. So he dumped his backpack in the woods and kept like only the essentials. So that’s why he only had a tarp, a sleeping bag and a rope. And a fishing pole. He’d kept the fishing pole thinking he could fend for himself. We saw him on Day 10. So he had been going for eight days without a backpack, lost in the middle of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness. And, he did the right thing which was to walk downstream in a large drainage, and eventually you’re going to hit a larger stream and follow that out. And he was on his way down to Moose Creek, so we had an EMT that was on the crew and the crew leader at that time decided that they needed to get this guy back to the ranger station and the permanent Wilderness Ranger back at Moose Creek was out on a hitch. She had just left that morning as well, so she was out the same distance we were in the opposite direction; she was going up Moose Ridge. We got her on the radio and they decided to meet back up at the rangersStation. So the EMT and Ian walked this gentleman back down to Moose Creek after we had given him some food. We gave him an orange and he ate it like an apple, peel and everything. Just bit right into it. Didn’t care that there was a peel on it, just ate the entire thing. They got him back to Moose Creek, called the LEO and sure enough, he was a missing person. He was a tourist, and he wanted to stop in the Selway to do a quick overnight, and he got turned around. He lost the trail in the snow and, you know, that’s what happens in wilderness. It’s a big area and it will swallow you up. It does not care. It will swallow you up and that’s a prime example of just how rugged that terrain is, and how isolated and large it is. So that was a pretty neat experience for me, just to say that we found a missing person and just helped this guy. I think he has a new-found respect for Idaho’s wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Nice! So you’re mentioning Moose Creek and Three Forks area and one of the things we’re interested in is just the idea of community in this isolated, vast place. What are the gathering places – how do you conceive of the gathering places back there, where people find community?</p>
<p><strong>EM</strong>: I would say that the main gathering places that I know of in the Selway-Bitterroot are obviously – the first one being Moose Creek. Which is the prime Ranger Station and administrative site back there. The other ones are probably Horse Camp, just because they use it on the Clearwater as a base for trail crew operations. Shearer, and then the lookouts, of course, but those aren’t really gathering places, I wouldn’t say. The community at Moose Creek is something completely unique that I have never experienced in my life before going back in there. Rob was talking about it at the beginning of the season, and him and I had the chance to fly back there, which was cheating at that time. We flew back there with Bob Schumaker just to see it before we hiked in, to kind of get an idea of the structures and the layout and stuff, and the history. When we hiked in, not only did it feel like we earned the right to be there, but you’re just immersed in this family. Since it is an administrative site, and they run research projects and trail crews, and volunteer and MCC, the Selway-Bitterroot Foundation, I mean, it’s a busy place. It’s a busy place. That is what makes it so great is that everyone is back there for the same reason. They want the wilderness to remain as wild as possible. The only reason that they’re back there and using that site is so that they can access these extremely remote areas. I don’t think nearly any of the work would get done if Moose Creek wasn’t there. The family, like I was saying, it’s completely unique. I long to go there every season, I really do. It’s amazing. You wake up early in the morning and there’s a packer who’s been up since 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. He’s got a pot of the darkest, jet-fueled coffee on the stove and he’s kicked back in a chair, sitting by the fire. He’s just sitting there. You walk in and he grumbles something through his bushely moustache and you go over and get a cup of coffee, and your eyes are all foggy, and people are trickling in. You sit down and maybe play a game of cribbage with the other packer who happens to be there. Then the ranger comes in, and everyone: oh, good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning! Pancakes start getting fried up, dishes are done and then you’re out in the field, taking down fence and working all day and you’re sweating and your back hurts. Even though airplanes are flying in and it’s just such a unique, like, melting pot. You get so many different user groups in there. There’s just a buzz. There&#8217;s an energy and people are excited to be back to be in the place that they love. And that’s just the best feeling ever, because you can&#8217;t replace that with anything. You can&#8217;t find that anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: So that&#8217;s a very different experience than a homecoming in the front country?</p>
<p><strong>EM</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>EM:</strong> Because it&#8217;s so… The front country is easy. You drive to your home. You ride a bike or whatever. It&#8217;s so… it&#8217;s what you expect. Getting back into Moose Creek… for one thing, you earn it. You walk back there under your own power, carrying tools and doing work along the way, and when you get back there, not only is it like a sense of accomplishment, but it&#8217;s just this, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s that primordial&#8211;your senses are heightened when you&#8217;re back there and you become an animal again. Even though you&#8217;re at this administrative site. But there&#8217;s just something about it, you know? Like you just take, you slow down, and you can appreciate things, and you just become aware of your surroundings and where you are. It doesn&#8217;t even compare to being in a city because you have gridded streets. You get back there, and it&#8217;s just such a simpler form of life. It really is like taking a step back in time and getting back to the roots of our existence as a species, and part of this community of life.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-4.mp3"">Download Podcast</a></p>"
sbw285,Legends of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness,"March 28, 2011",2011-03-28,Episode 3,sbw285.mp3,10:04,"In this episode, titled “Legends of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness,” Jean Carroll recalls stories and legends that populate the backcountry, taking on a life of their own as they pass from campfire to campfire, and are retold on the front porches of log cabins or during breaks along the long trail.

Jean Renshaw Carroll is the author of the book,<em> I Never Felt Poor, Except in Town. Selway Saga 1932 to 1948</em>. In her stirring history and memoir, Jean shares about her experiences growing up at Selway Lodge, near the mouth of Bear Creek. She tells lively tales of exploits with her siblings living deep in the wilderness, of the hunters, pilots, trappers, fishermen and guests from all over the country, who visited her family’s home, and of the work she did, helping her father, Alvin Renshaw, with various duties around the ranch and, later, cooking for her brother Jim’s fishing parties. This paragraph is an excerpt from Jean’s book.

<blockquote>Each year, as we rode along the trail, I felt all my senses coming alive to the earthy smells and varied vivid greens of the trees and undergrowth, to the bright yellow patches of the balsamroot, and to the song of the river roaring through canyons or tinkling and murmuring along the deep holes. Always, too, I breathed in that familiar smell of horses and listened to the creak of the saddle leather and clop clop of hooves hitting rock or plopping through mud. Spring runoff all along the watershed would be sending cascades of water off the mountains so that we rode by numerous waterfalls not present any other time of year. As we rode toward our ranch home and simple life on the Selway, I rejoiced again in the fact that I never felt poor, except in town. On the Selway I felt rich… rich in freedom and rich in experience.

TOPIC: Legends of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness</em></p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Jean has written a book called, <em>I Never Felt Poor, Except In Town</em>, and I was just interested, Jean, if you could talk about your first memories of being back in the wilderness, back at Selway Lodge.</p>
<p><strong>JC</strong>: I was sitting in front of Dad in the saddle, going up the trail and feeling very, very tired.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: You’ve talked in your book, that there’s certain places like the Salmon hole and Archer’s Grave and Elevator Mountain that kind of held a mystery. Can you talk about that?</p>
<p><strong>JC</strong>: Elevator Mountain has a cave, that you can see from the Selway Trail. Well the story was that the Magruder Party, when they were killed, the murderers took some of the gold and hid it in Elevator Cave. But it never looked to me like you could get to it. And you had to… when Punk Wolfinbarger’s wife died, he took her ashes into the cave. Then he died in June and they have taken his ashes to the cave. And from the plane, it did look like there was a sort of a trail there that you could make.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Yeah, do you remember the Magruder story? Do you mind telling it on tape?</p>
<p><strong>JC</strong>: Well, Hill Beachy and Magruder were really good friends. Magruder was a merchant and Hill Beachy ran a hotel. Magruder used to go to Virginia City, which I don’t even know where that is. He would take groceries and bring back gold, from wherever. He picked up some guys, to come back with him. They didn’t have pack strings, they just had big bunches of mules, herded, so it took more than one or two people to do it. Then, around the head of the Selway, these people that he had picked up decided they were going to murder Magruder and his people, and so they did. They took the gold, and I heard several stories, that the mules followed, or tried to, so they shot the mules. And I don’t know whether that’s a true story or not. And I don’t know what they did with all the gold. Maybe some went in the cave, maybe not. Anyway, they went back to Lewiston, and the murderer, the main guy, was riding Magruder’s horse. That is the stupidest thing to do, because of course Hill Beachy would recognize it. And besides that, one of the stories is that Hill Beachy had a dream where he saw Magruder killed with an axe. So, if that was true, or maybe it wasn’t true, but just the fact that the guy was riding the horse, and Magruder didn’t come back, made him suspicious. So suspicious, that when these guys left on the boat to go to Portland, or wherever, California, I guess, he followed them and somehow, he got the Sheriff at that place to arrest them and he brought them back. Hill Beachy brought them back. One guy told about it, he wasn’t real smart. So they hung all the rest of them, there in Lewiston. The guy who had provided the evidence, he was dead within a year, drinking or something.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Wow, yeah, I’ve read the story but it sounds very good coming from a local person.</p>
<p><strong>JC</strong>: Up Bear Creek, there’s a place we call Salmon Hole, I guess there’s salmon holes up Moose Creek also. But this one, I haven’t been up Moose Creek to see. This one up Bear Creek had what Dad called an oven and he said that the Indians used it. They used to go through there and catch salmon. There used to be a lot of salmon and there is a picture of them as they came back, as they returned. Because there for a long time there weren’t any salmon. When I was little, because they built a dam down at Lewiston. Anyway, I guess they dried or baked the salmon in that oven.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Did you guys go up to the Salmon Hole very often?</p>
<p><strong>JC</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Did you ever find any arrowheads or anything?</p>
<p><strong>JC</strong>: I never did but other people said they did. I was never looking for arrowheads.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: You were just fishing.</p>
<p><strong>JC</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: Uhm… what about Archer’s Grave? Did you see…</p>
<p><strong>JC</strong>: That’s up Running Creek, and of course the story is, Sid Poppe and Sid Poppe is the one that made a cross that said “look before you leap” on it.</p>
<p><strong>DL</strong>: And why?</p>
<p><strong>JC</strong>: Oh, because he had been, I can’t remember what he had been doing in the wintertime. He was skiing off of that. Maybe he was trapping. He skied the wrong place and went over a bluff. It killed him.</p>","<p>Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-3b.mp3"">Download Podcast</a></p>

 In 1931 Alvin Renshaw and his wife bought the Pettibone Ranch, which was later renamed Selway Lodge, near the mouth of Bear Creek along the Selway River and just a mile and a half from what would later become Shearer Guard Station. In 1932 Alvin, his wife, and their three small children made their new home deep within what is now the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness. Jim was just two months old at the time. For the next sixteen years the Renshaw family made their living as outfitters, hosting numerous guests from all over the country at the Selway Lodge. Although Alvin sold the business and lodge in 1948, his son Jim began packing for the new owners of the Selway Lodge. Jim later bought an old homestead at Trout Creek, near Three Forks in the Moose Creek drainage, where he and his wife operated an outfitting business in the wilderness. Jim officially retired in 1998, but continues to pack for volunteer trail crews that go into the Selway-Bitterroot yearly for trail maintenance.",Jim Renshaw,http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-2b.mp3?_=3,"Jim Renshaw, Februrary 2011",https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/jimrenshaw2011.jpg,sbw284_img.jpg,"[{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/jimrenshaw2011.jpg"",""id"":""78"",""title"":""jimrenshaw2011"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Jim Renshaw, wilderness outfitter and packer, 2011"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/jimrenshawbackpack.jpg"",""id"":""79"",""title"":""jimrenshawbackpack"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Jim Renshaw as a young man backpacking in the Selway-Bitterroot, 1964"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/jimrenshawfamily.jpg"",""id"":""80"",""title"":""jimrenshawfamily"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Jim Renshaw with his family at Moose Creek Ranches, 1958"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/jimrenshawfish.jpg"",""id"":""81"",""title"":""jimrenshawfish"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Jim Renshaw fishing in North Three Links Lakes in the Selway Crags, 1965"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/jimrenshawfishlake.jpg"",""id"":""82"",""title"":""Jim Renshaw, flew in with Larry\u0026nbsp;Dutcher"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Jim Renshaw at Fish Lake, his favorite place in the Selway-Bitterroot, 1963"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/jimrenshawhorse.jpg"",""id"":""83"",""title"":""Jim Renshaw and\u0026nbsp;Terry"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Jim Renshaw and his horse Terry, Wounded Doe, 1965"",""itemprop"":""image""},{""src"":""https:\/\/selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/jimrenshawselwaylodge.jpg"",""id"":""84"",""title"":""Jim and Queen at Selway Lodge,\u0026nbsp;1958"",""alt"":"""",""caption"":""Jim Renshaw and his dog Queen at Selway Lodge, 1958"",""itemprop"":""image""}]",https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/encounters-with-animals-in-the-selway-bitterroot-wilderness/,"<p>Interview with Jim Renshaw<br />

TOPIC: Encounters with Animals in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> As a packer, and a hunter and, did you ever do any trapping?</p>
<p><strong>JR:</strong> Not legally.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> But, I mean as someone who’s basically living really close to the land and really close to animals, you know, wild animals as well as domesticated animals.  Do you feel like you have a pretty close relationship with animals, and how would you describe that?</p>
<p><strong>JR:</strong> Oh definitely.  Well, of course, I’m an elk hunter.  Elk made my living for me and I love them.  I’m real sorry to see we’re losing out on elk.  But as far as trapping, the last winter that we stayed in, up there, I wanted to trap.  I did, I caught some bobcat.  I think I caught three bobcat in the traps, and Dad and I treed a couple with the hounds and got them.  Without letting anybody know, I tried to catch a beaver.  I didn’t.  I mean, I didn’t know how.  Did catch one mink, but I had help in setting the trap.  I caught a pine squirrel too, but my trapping experience was not much.  You know, as far as a feeling toward the animals, yes, I do have feelings toward them.  I have compassion, even,  for an animal, even though it was my living to see if we couldn’t kill them.  I’ve got one particular instance with a bull elk I’ll never forget.  I had a hunter up on the hill and the bull come around under us and he shot and wounded it, and so I told him, I says, you stay here and I’ll go chase it down.  I was five hours tracking it.  It did—It was intelligent.  It was thinking.  It was an intelligent animal.  It got out in the middle of a creek and walked upstream.  It did all kinds— it circled me and I never did see it; I was just following the tracks.  I finally caught up with it.  It got out into a patch of boulders and it had a broken leg, is what it had.  But it couldn’t go any farther.  It turned around and was popping its teeth at me.  It said, I went just as far as I can.  Yeah, so I finished it off.  And he kind of had the last laugh.  That was the first elk I ever had to carry out to my mules, because I couldn’t get my mules in to where he was at, you know.  You gotta admire an animal like that.  He was doing his best to get away from me.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> And your mules.  You have had a close relationship with your mules.</p>
<p><strong>JR:</strong> Oh yeah, they are kind of like part of the family.  I’ve had the opportunity to tell some other people that some people shouldn’t have mules.  A mule is a little more intelligent than a horse.  And I’ve had horses that I’ve just loved.  You just can’t help but do it.  I’ve had horses that were just as good as any mule and I’ve had mules that were just as good as any horse.  People will say, which one’s the best animal to pack?  It depends on the animal entirely.  People said, why don’t you ride the mule?  Well, I’d rather look at the ears behind me.  I won’t argue:  Mules can be good saddle animals, but I want to ride a horse and pack a mule.  But I’ll pack horses.  I’ve had horses that were as good a pack animal as any mule that there ever was, but a mule doesn’t worry, and a horse does.  A mule’s going to kind of take care of itself.  They’ve got the name of being stubborn.  Well, they’re not.  They’re smart. You won’t get one of them in trouble, where you can get a horse in trouble.  And generally if you’ve got a problem, it’s human-caused, not animal-caused.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So what’s it like to have a mule wreck?</p>
<p><strong>JR:</strong> A wreck?</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>JR: </strong>I haven’t had very many.  I just haven’t.  But it’s pretty bad.  I’ve never crippled one of them or anything.  I’ve had a couple of them get off the trail and roll down over the hill, but that was actually in the latter part of my time doing it, and part of that was caused because  I can’t turn around and look back like I used to.  I put a couple of them off – well actually it was a horse and a mule off the trail up on boulder creek because I had them strung out wrong. I had a horse in the lead that if she got her hind leg over the rope, she’d sit down.  And I’d had her do it a time or two but it wasn’t bad. Well, anyway, she’d sit down in the wrong spot there.  Her and the mule tied to her rolled down over the hill.  That was pretty scary but they survived it okay.  The other wreck was with a different mule and I don’t know what happened.  I looked back and I was short three head.  I didn’t know anything had happened.   I went back and two of them were standing in the trail, kind of mixed up, but the one mule had rolled down over the hill until it couldn’t roll any farther.  It wasn’t hurt any, but I had to go down and take the pack off from it and roll it over and get it up out of there and carry the pack up and put it back on, but I don’t know what caused that. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So, I’ll ask you one final question.  This is more of your opinion.  Why do you think certain people are drawn to this part of Idaho, the Selway country, the Lochsa country.  The Bitterroots.</p>
<p><strong>JR:</strong> Probably because they’ve been other places and this is the best place they’ve found.  </p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> What does the best place mean?  </p>
<p><strong>JR:</strong> Fish Lake.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>JR:</strong> I and a couple of other guys did take a week’s trip about ten years ago over onto Big Creek on the Salmon River.  I enjoyed that because there were some big meadows.  Lots of horse feed.  For scenery, the Selway’s got it beat, because you’ve got the rocks and the lakes and stuff like that.  And another thing now, the Forest Service fixed the trails up in the Selway to where they are so good.  I mean it’s so much better than they were when I started. They used to be, I don’t know how we did it. It was bad.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Okay, well, thank you so much, Jim.</p>","Optional: <a href=""http://www.debbiejlee.com/Selway-Podcast-2b.mp3"">Download Podcast</a></p>

Who attached themselves to the Selway-Bitterroot, and why? What about people’s practices and beliefs and their interaction with the land itself preserved its wild character? What do people’s stories tell us about relationships between people and wildland that might be applicable to the future of U.S. wildernesses more broadly? The oral histories gathered for the Selway-Bitterroot History Project will attempt to answer these questions. Such stories are critical to capturing specific fields of information relating to the Selway-Bitterroot. Oral history interviewees include those who were raised on or who owned early homesteads as well as outfitters, packers, trappers, former Fish and Game conservation officers, pilots, early river-runners, smokejumpers, early trail crew members, and wilderness workers. Many lived and worked in the Selway-Bitterroot when the 1964 Wilderness Act was passed and were some of the first people in the U.S. to interpret the legislation as it played out on the ground.

<em>Interview with Sarah Walker<br />

December 15, 2010<br />
Interviewed by Debbie Lee and Jane Holman, Moscow, Idaho</em></p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> The first one I met was the community of the people who lived along the Upper Selway, especially Punk and Carolyn at North Star Ranch. So through them and through that experience, and Freddy and Everett Pierce who lived at Selway Lodge. That was a fascinating thing for me to see how people lived there all year. And I got to go in there because Dick knew those people, and because he could fly there, because the access was by foot or airstrip or plane—and just to see how they how they did day-to-day life was really—I just loved it. There were lots of visitors in the summer and then hunting season was nuts, and then after that things sort of settled down into a dull routine, and I got to go in sometimes then, too, in the winter when the strip was open. And Punk and Carolyn just—they had their wood cook range and their little place where they lived and the low ceiling and the hissing Coleman lantern, and Carolyn made sourdough pancakes right on the top of the metal stove, and she made gallons and gallons of wine from fruit that she picked, and you know when make fruit wine it usually tastes pretty sweet and awful like cough syrup type things, but this wasn’t. It was dry and delicious, and we all drank tons of homemade wine, and Carolyn was a great storyteller. And, isolation meant that she drew stories—she used to memorize the humor sections of the Reader’s Digest and spout this stuff, which sounds funny now to hear, but at the time it was just extraordinary. Anyway, she also wrote poetry, and read a lot of poetry, and she was very widely read. She was a very interesting person. And so, they were sort of the elders of that community. And then younger parts of it, like my niece Sarah Swett worked for Punk and Carolyn. They always had a helper. And then she married a guy named Ian Barlow, and they were caretakers at the Ranch next door called Running Creek. And so they lived there together for four or five years from about 1981 to 85 or so. And then before that, Dolly Carroll&#8211;another helper of Punk and Carolyn’&#8211;and her husband Alan Carroll lived at Running Creek, and they even got married there and had a wedding there. So part of this community was going in there and going to a wedding in the wilderness. Of course I had already had my own wedding in the Wilderness, but that’s later. So, and we went there for Thanksgiving once to Running Creek. And it was just—once you were there, it was a community feeling, it was—that’s all—those were the only people who were there and you were shut off from the rest of the world in a really remote spot. It was fun.</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> So are there any examples you can think of besides the wine and the pancakes. It’s food and stories.</p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> Well people loved to go there. And Punk and Carolyn had a lot of friends, and they would come in and see them and come in and stay usually. There were endless stories about a lot people I never met, about old so-and-so, he’s a good old boy, and she’s a pistol. For somebody like me coming from back East this was a real eye-opener, because I had not met people like that&#8211;that’s how they were to me in a way, they were these wonderful characters. </p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yeah. So you were at the wedding that you mentioned?</p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> Dolly and Allan’s?</p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Yeah. Can you describe it, something you can remember specifically, or even something that was peculiar or interesting about it that particularly sticks in your mind?</p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> Well, they had, the people who were invited to the wedding were an interesting group because we’d gone in to Punk and Carolyn’s the day before or something, and stayed up late the night before, and I’m sure mourning Dolly’s marriage because everybody loved Dolly—ahhhh. So by the time the day of the wedding came we were all kind of shot, but we did hike over there, and Running Creek Ranch is another small, low-ceiling building, spick-and-span inside with a polished&#8211;old, but polished up&#8211;wood range to cook on in the kitchen, and this little kitchen and not much room in there.
