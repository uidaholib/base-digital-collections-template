00:00:00:00 - 00:00:43:10
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
So the night we got in a, luncheon. Pancakes or ruined rolled cakes, but still need to have something to eat at noon. And that evening, then they want us to stay and get the evening meal for them. Well, that was my first attempt at cooking outside over a fireplace. And also, this is Taylor's first attempt that we managed to get something for the men to eat that night.


00:00:43:12 - 00:01:11:12
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And they fixed the bed for us. right along with the side of the horse. It they had taken in there. And the horses kept stopping and doing and stopping and trying to fight the flies all night long. So we didn't get very much sleep, but the next morning they wanted us to continue, come and take care of the men we had.


00:01:11:13 - 00:01:13:18
Unknown Interviewer:
I mean, did you have.


00:01:13:21 - 00:01:44:08
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
We had about, 10 or 15 that we were taking things and trying to fix for them, and they had their own provisions that we had to take care of the provisions and the cooking, by the way. It took me years to like potatoes, and I cooked some potatoes and work and watered buckets over the fire. And I didn't like potatoes for a long, long.


00:01:44:08 - 00:01:46:06
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
But after that.


00:01:46:09 - 00:01:52:06
Sam Schrager:
Where were you prepared to go on with them? You did have your clothing and all year long.


00:01:52:09 - 00:01:55:23
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
We just learned of what we had got along.


00:01:55:29 - 00:01:58:11
Unknown Interviewer:
The left side being.


00:01:58:13 - 00:02:54:05
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Because they had the they had to keep on working and going, but they had, man. What would you name Johnny. Johnny. Johnny. Johnny. anyway, he was a man here in town that we knew. that was, cook. And he had gone on the firefighting crew just for the experience and was a cook, and they left him up on the top of what we call the, freeze up ridge when they can't there that the night before coming on to to our cabin and the left him up there and he said that he would pack things and have everything all ready and that the crew coming through could pick them up.


00:02:54:07 - 00:03:25:06
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And then he'd cut of cross-country and come over to this part of the country. And. But Johnny missed the Packers and Johnny missed everything when he started on a cross-country and he got lost. And so he just kept traveling that he said he thought he'd find something sometime. He finally landed in the camp, but at that time they needed firefighters to.


00:03:25:06 - 00:03:45:27
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Then that Johnny wasn't allowed to cook. He was put on the firefighting and and this is Durham and I continued cooking and then they brought in team what do they come? They were short termers.


00:03:45:29 - 00:03:48:12
Sam Schrager:
You told me about that? Yeah.


00:03:48:15 - 00:04:16:26
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
That you could stand right. And, they had a camp right next to ours, but they had their own cook. And finally the Mr. Roach Gaines that Mrs. Taylor and the, man and a lanky to help us up. So we didn't have quite so much work to do after that. But but at any rate, Johnny was put on the firing line.


00:04:16:28 - 00:04:22:06
Unknown Interviewer:
And how long did you cook for the mail, How long did you cook for them?


00:04:22:07 - 00:04:39:00
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
We cook for over 40 days. We get. The government paid us 40 or a little over 40 days, for our service. How much? Firefighters? Well, I don't know, 40 something dollars. It was about a dollar a day. I think it.


00:04:39:03 - 00:04:43:14
Sam Schrager:
What did you think of the of the experience at the time?


00:04:43:16 - 00:04:44:20
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
I mean, at the time, yeah, at.


00:04:44:20 - 00:04:45:18
Unknown Interviewer:
The time, what did you think.


00:04:45:18 - 00:05:24:26
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
It was? Just experience. That was all always something new coming up. Something that you weren't expecting, like the fire. And one morning it was so smoky outside after a perfectly still night. And then the smoke would drop down with the, I suppose with the dampness in the evening that the smoke would drop down and I heard, noise that, on the clearing near Mrs., Cochran's cabin.


00:05:24:29 - 00:05:53:14
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And I got up and Mrs. Taylor said, what are you going to do? And I'm going to see what the racket is. And so I got up, put on my robe, went outside and took my gun. I had and, revolver along with me. And I took my gun and went outside. And just at the edge of the clearing on the other side was a beautiful little deer.


00:05:53:16 - 00:06:13:18
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
I never had shot a deer. I never went and eaten the meat Monday. So I thought, oh, gee, that would be good to have some meat. So I took old Betsy and aimed at the deer. Well, about that time the gun began to go this way, this way and this way, this way, and let them down and up and down.


00:06:13:21 - 00:06:31:10
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And I got and I couldn't shoot. I couldn't shoot that deer. I just had what they would do that. So I missed the deer. And I went back into the cabin and stayed there. I finally got over my buck fever.


00:06:31:12 - 00:06:35:16
Sam Schrager:
His brother has buck fever. What happens when you try to shoot it?


00:06:35:18 - 00:06:37:14
Unknown Interviewer:
Yeah, that's when you get the,


00:06:37:16 - 00:06:49:13
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
You get buck fever. That is your nervousness. Your entire nervous. And, the nerves of your body are all of control. And you're.


00:06:49:13 - 00:06:50:04
Unknown Interviewer:
Again, buck.


00:06:50:04 - 00:07:02:26
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Fever. Your gun, means nothing. You just go one way or the other. I tried holding him with both hands, and it didn't work and anything, so I just turned around.


00:07:02:28 - 00:07:08:03
Unknown Interviewer:
And Sam, this year would tell you the final chapter of this. Mr. Roach.


00:07:08:05 - 00:07:08:16
Sam Schrager:
Yes.


00:07:08:16 - 00:07:10:19
Unknown Interviewer:
I think she was over on.


00:07:10:22 - 00:07:14:15
Sam Schrager:
Yes. From Pierce. Yes. He he apologized. And, you know, I'm.


00:07:14:15 - 00:07:16:02
Unknown Interviewer:
Sorry, I've forgotten.


00:07:16:05 - 00:07:26:01
Sam Schrager:
I was going to ask you when you were, on that fire, cooking. Did you ever have to move the camp to get away from the fire?


00:07:27:14 - 00:08:02:05
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
not exactly. The. We were camped on one side of the river, and they decided that that was a for a place where I camped. more level place across on the other side. So they fixed up the fireplace on the other side and moved our camp over. Well, the firefighters were all out on the line, and, one day there was a heavy wind came up and the.


00:08:02:08 - 00:08:33:00
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
We noticed that the men were beginning to come in off of the fire line, both at our camp and at the other camp, the Montana camp across the line. And we want to know what. And they said, well, this is there's nearly a clear place, as there is from here up to where the fire line is. And, they said there's no, no way of stopping it with this wind.


00:08:33:03 - 00:09:04:12
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And we said, well, what do we do? They said, there's only one thing to do that we can tell. That's to take your blankets and go down to the stream. And if the fire comes close, get into the water and cover your head with the blanket, believing in air space, and stay until they fire is passed over. It may be awfully hot, but if you're in the water, you possibly could survive anyway.


00:09:04:14 - 00:09:28:09
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
That would be the only way of doing it. So that's what the men in the two men that they left for lanky boys with us, and the men that have drifted back and got their blankets. We went down to the stream, and we sat there on the log at the edge of the stream, and watched the fire coming.


00:09:28:12 - 00:10:00:17
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Well, somewhere. Well, we were sitting there, somewhere along nature took a funny little quirk, and a wind began coming from the other direction and forced the fire back. And it was in a within a very short distance of where we were camp there at the creek. But it forced the fire back the other way, and it didn't come into our little corner of the woods.


00:10:00:19 - 00:10:06:21
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
So we were in we were very fortunate that time. I thought I'd said goodbye to everybody.


00:10:06:24 - 00:10:07:24
Unknown Interviewer:
We did.


00:10:07:26 - 00:10:33:25
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And so my father went out to Clarksville and tried his best to get Mike Peake or someone to give him a horse and let him go up to our cabin. You want to know what had happened to us? He hadn't heard from us and he didn't know what had happened to us. And he had a daughter out there somewhere, and the men wouldn't give him the horse.


00:10:33:25 - 00:10:52:26
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
They wouldn't allow him to leave Clarke. Yet we had to stay there and it and get word if he could. But, he stayed there for a few days, but they couldn't get any word from us because of the fire gate. Any kind of grass.


00:10:52:28 - 00:11:11:14
Unknown Interviewer:
Well, she came home and she was wearing these filthy, dirty clothes. Her hair was sister. Eyebrows were kind of laughing at our faces and had a revolver around her waist, and she could clomping up the street.


00:11:11:17 - 00:11:13:19
Unknown Interviewer:
And we're very glad to hear.


00:11:13:22 - 00:11:18:13
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Oh dear, why does this man then actually do?


00:11:18:13 - 00:11:27:15
Unknown Interviewer:
You wrote you told him that I own, You told him that about Pearce. About what? About Medium and Pearce.


00:11:27:18 - 00:11:28:22
Sam Schrager:
Oh, she told you?


00:11:28:23 - 00:11:57:01
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Don't. I don't tell you about meeting Pearce. But far we were on the fire line there. Actually, Jay Roach was taken from that heat this summer and all the responsibilities and the and the fire and the firemen and, and he got a very severe case of diarrhea for stomach diarrhea. And he came back in the camp looking like a lost sheep.


00:11:57:04 - 00:12:25:14
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
I never saw anybody look like he didn't. And I said, what's the trouble? And he told me and I said, well, I can't go myself because I have to stay and help Mrs. Taylor get something for your men to eat tonight. But if you will give me a man by the name of rickets, which I knew here in Moscow, I knew his wife and and Jack Ricketts.


00:12:25:16 - 00:12:49:12
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And I said, I'll tell him where to get some medicine in my cabin, and I'll send him back to the cabin and get something which I think will help you with my father. Being a doctor had given us all kinds of an array medicine that he thought we would possibly use, and I knew where it was, what it was.


00:12:49:14 - 00:13:15:27
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And then he found Ricketts, and I sent Ricketts back to the cabin, and Ricketts got some clean clothes for me and some clean clothes for Mrs. Taylor on his trip. And the medicine for AJ Rose. Well, AJ wrote, took it and within the short time was able to get back on the firing line again and make sure.


00:13:15:27 - 00:13:17:06
Unknown Interviewer:
And I said to him.


00:13:17:08 - 00:13:21:15
Sam Schrager:
Yeah, you were pretty nice to him, considering that he wasn't very nice to, you.


00:13:21:21 - 00:13:31:15
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Know, it wasn't. But then the man was in trouble and he and and help and I had the means of giving it to him, so I got it for him.


00:13:31:15 - 00:13:33:24
Sam Schrager:
What did you think of of him, though?


00:13:34:01 - 00:13:35:02
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
What did I think of him?


00:13:35:02 - 00:13:35:29
Sam Schrager:
Yes.


00:13:36:14 - 00:14:00:16
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
I didn't think very much of him, but I had to respect him that because he was at the end and the camp and all, and any disrespect should not have been given to him because he was doing the job he was given to do, although he was not trained, trained for it, and he was doing the best he could.


00:14:00:18 - 00:14:05:04
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
But I didn't like him.


00:14:05:07 - 00:14:06:13
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And didn't like him at all.


00:14:06:16 - 00:14:08:00
Unknown Interviewer:
Now, what's your next question?


00:14:08:04 - 00:14:20:20
Sam Schrager:
If the homesteaders, if the homesteaders had been able to prove up on those places, would they have sold to the lumber company after it proved up?


00:14:21:09 - 00:14:51:06
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
the lumber companies were in this part of the country all through in that section of the country, target and the middle country and beyond. And from their gear on up into a ring, they were buying the timber from these homesteaders and those that were allowed to, to improve, that sold their places. But those the others lost didn't last the time.


00:14:51:06 - 00:14:56:27
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And lost the money that it took to do their improving. And,


00:14:57:00 - 00:15:02:17
Sam Schrager:
Would there have been, a pretty good profit for the people who would prove they.


00:15:02:19 - 00:15:30:05
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
That time? most of the people out there would get, all the way from 3000 to 8000, depending upon the sand, timber on the particular location. And it some of them got along very nicely. This LC file, I just don't remember rightly whether she sold hers or whether she lost it.


00:15:30:06 - 00:15:31:12
Sam Schrager:
I think she lost.


00:15:31:13 - 00:16:06:24
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
She lost it. I think so, Mrs. Brown, Della Brown. Griffith had a claim, like, close to Mrs. File and I think that that she got her claim. Some of them did in that location. Some didn't remember me telling you about dynamite being at our door when Carter got back, he said that, no, not Carter, but then.


00:16:06:27 - 00:16:48:01
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And then the the name of Fleming came in. Myrtle and I had been out to Moscow to see Mrs. in Durham when she was in the hospital, and Carter took us out, but Carter had some other business on hand and didn't want to take us back. And, so my father made a call, Avery, and found that there was a man there by the name of Fleming, AJ Fleming from Canada, that knew that section of the country and the trail and would be glad to take us back to the homestead.


00:16:48:04 - 00:17:26:04
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And that's the way we got back to the homestead was by Fleming taking. Is that Fleming and Dynamite over at the boys cabin? And dynamite was staying with Hansen and Larsen, and they decided they wanted something to read. And they knew that Mrs. Brown had left a lot of reading material and her cabin. So they decided that they would go over and get some of this material and bring it over to us so that we might have something to read.


00:17:26:04 - 00:17:58:01
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Likewise. Well, when they went to investigating the cabin, they found, phonograph records, and we had of one of these little tiny for the the first little phonograph was just mind blowing horn. And, we had one of those and then so they saw these records over there and decided that they bring us some records. So they brought over a load of records for us.


00:17:58:03 - 00:18:14:24
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
We had a great time playing those records we and heard before, and they brought the magazines for us. And, Fleming spent two nights or three nights there with us. And then he the.


00:18:14:24 - 00:18:31:00
Unknown Interviewer:
One that, like this liquor, Was he the one that like liquor? Of course it was taboo for the comes. And one of these two men, he was taking them out on the back of where they were going.


00:18:31:03 - 00:18:42:21
Unknown Interviewer:
As they were crossing a little bridge, he looked down and said, well, there is a bottle of whiskey. We should take my place perfectly well. He stated that they had a he had that, and he.


00:18:42:21 - 00:18:54:20
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Climbed down off of the bridge and down under the front picked it up and they were never been opened. Somebody had lost the bottle of liquor and he picked it up. I thought.


00:18:54:20 - 00:18:55:05
Unknown Interviewer:
That was pretty.


00:18:55:05 - 00:19:21:24
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Smart. And he said, we'll just take it with us. We might need it. Well, he was just getting over a Saint Patrick's Day and, booze up there, and he'd been drunk for quite a while. But then the man at the, office said that he was all right and he knew the country and that he was over sufficient, that the he could take us back in.


00:19:21:27 - 00:19:50:06
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Well, we picked up the bottle of liquor, and he started to put it in his bag and his knapsack, and I said, Andre, I think I'd like that. And he turned around and gave me a look and handed me the bottle. Well, I put the bottle in my knapsack then, and carried it, and I thought, well, you don't carry me unless you take me with it.


00:19:50:08 - 00:20:02:10
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Well, we got, to the cabin where the government cabin. I way cabin between Avery and the homestead. And,


00:20:02:12 - 00:20:08:06
Unknown Interviewer:
That was just the lean to. Was just boughs put up to keep the rain off you. There's no cabin.


00:20:08:06 - 00:20:32:09
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Oh, yes. It was just a lean to it. Wasn't the cabin. It was just a name to a three sided lean to with a roof over it. And you built your fire up in front of it, and the heat come in to supposedly to keep you warm. It did, but it also melted the snow on the roof, and the water dropped down your back in the middle of the night and scared the life out of you.


00:20:32:11 - 00:21:04:08
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
But at any rate, we reached the cabin at the bottom of and a half up in the cabin. it says, what do I call it? Steel. Wood liquor cut off with him. And he got to the point that he just couldn't carry his knapsack any longer. It was too heavy. So Myrtle and I divided the knapsack and put it on our bags and helped A.J.


00:21:04:08 - 00:21:35:00
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
As near as we could till we got to the lean to. Well, he curled up at the lean to for a little while, and we gathered up a little kindling. Everyone. It was supposed to use the lingo. We're supposed to leave kindling enough or wood enough for the following fumes. And we started a fire. sign got, AJ next to the fire and got in.


00:21:35:02 - 00:22:07:05
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Started. Slow down a little bit and, I said, would you like a drink? And he said he would love it so many. And I mixed up and put on some, it got some hot water and then, then the vessels there, and we fixed up a drink for each service, making it light. But with it. And the liquor was enough.


00:22:07:05 - 00:22:32:01
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
The Fleming soon got through enough that he could get up and get firewood, enough to keep us. Sure, they night, and he sat up with the fire and kept things going, and we stayed inside the lean to, and the water dripping and. But in the morning we all got up and had our breakfast and started on to the cabin.


00:22:32:04 - 00:22:33:29
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
We got through the night all right.


00:22:34:01 - 00:22:39:14
Unknown Interviewer:
And I was finding that liquor was a good thing.


00:22:40:18 - 00:23:12:15
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
AJ Fleming was a remittance man from Canada. He had been shipped over from England and, was a remittance man in Canada and came down into that section of the country and just traveled around to get acquainted with the country. So he knew the country he was going into. In the meantime, he had gone down into Michigan somewhere.


00:23:12:18 - 00:23:51:20
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
I don't know just where, but and this is Borough and, Mrs. Bush, that's meant Mrs. William Burgh and Mrs. Bush had gone to this resort, and, we're spending a few days at the resort, and it happened to be the time that AJ Fleming came down from Canada, and he got acquainted with them. So when he came in and said that he knew Mrs. Barra and they knew Mrs. Bush and, it also helped to give us something that we could rely on.


00:23:51:20 - 00:24:20:29
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And we felt very much better about AJ Fleming after that. He was a funny man. He wrote poetry and he can spell poetry by the yards. And I have a phone, and I think I still have it in the, in the basement that, he wrote about the homesteaders out there, and he write part of it with his left hand and part of it with his right hand.


00:24:21:02 - 00:24:26:19
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
And it looked so funny to see the two different hand writings on this, on this farm.


00:24:26:21 - 00:24:31:17
Unknown Interviewer:
Where they any good, For the poems or the poems? Any good?


00:24:31:22 - 00:24:33:11
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Oh, yes, they were good.


00:24:33:14 - 00:24:35:02
Sam Schrager:
What is a remittance man?


00:24:35:07 - 00:24:36:18
Unknown Interviewer:
I thought about that.


00:24:36:21 - 00:24:38:06
Sam Schrager:
What is a remittance man?


00:24:38:09 - 00:24:55:15
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Oh, it is a man that doesn't conform with the way of life in England. And the family are practically ashamed of him. And so, in order to get him out of the way, they send him over to Canada.


00:24:55:17 - 00:24:57:04
Unknown Interviewer:
We pay him so much amount per.


00:24:57:04 - 00:25:23:23
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
Year as a British subject, he would be acceptable in Canada, and he was accepted in Canada. He had been in one of the wars and had a very deep scarlet country story in here and that India, his airline went and we asked him land. So he said, I suppose you're wondering where I got that scar. And he said, yes.


00:25:23:25 - 00:25:45:17
Ione "Pinkie" Adair:
So he told me he was doing such and such a war, and that didn't. He was wounded in the war, but other than that, scar was already had that then that showed in. He won. And that's why they call a remittance man. They pay for them.


00:25:45:19 - 00:25:46:20
Sam Schrager:
The parents do.
