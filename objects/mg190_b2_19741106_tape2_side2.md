North pasture. How long did it take you to put that in? I don't know. I talked with a pretty small batch and then work on Bring it on. It washed up on me around there on that point where that road goes around, you know.

Whatever his place is.

00;14;09;01 - 00;14;29;19

Speaker 3
And I come back and he said, yes, I wouldn't I don't I don't like you to do that. He said that if anything had happened to you, you'd fall off one of them or anything.

00;35;45;11 - 00;35;49;27
Speaker 1
Right in this hole with these guys you were talking about.

00;35;49;29 - 00;36;18;02
Speaker 4
And the writing was just right down here, this little island in the creek down here, it'd be quite a big picture. No, no, no. And just to the left of the trail, this side of the people where you go around and we're not blast kind of trial here. It's just the sound of that where you cross over that line right there against the kind of behind some.

00;36;18;02 - 00;36;19;29
Speaker 1
Topiary bush and so on.

00;36;20;01 - 00;36;25;02

Speaker 4
Might be.

00;36;49;28 - 00;36;50;21
Speaker 5
Or.

00;36;50;24 - 00;36;59;19
Speaker 1
Roughly about five mile or mean. They're five miles up the creek you'd hear.

00;36;59;22 - 00;37;04;15
Speaker 5
And they're on the trail through the creek. So you, you don't have. Well, they're on.

00;37;04;15 - 00;37;18;03
Speaker 4
But they that group right down here, the veteran getting out of the country and down here in the guard, you know where they're protected there in this boat overhang over and on the trail, the trail up.

Speaker 1
By a.

00;37;19;22 - 00;37;27;23
Speaker 4
Very careful this last time you went to recovery and quiet time getting older and get your way.

00;37;27;25 - 00;37;29;00

Speaker 1
Yellow lines awfully well. We take that only.

00;37;55;25 - 00;38;03;01
Speaker 4
One time that the sun ever hit them. And at that time, the morning right when the sun that time.

00;38;03;04 - 00;38;04;18
Speaker 1
That's summertime.

00;38;04;21 - 00;38;08;19
Speaker 4
They're manmade here. They're getting the right time. Let me know.

00;38;08;19 - 00;38;12;05
Speaker 5
When they throw, because we had a bad time getting down.

00;38;12;07 - 00;38;17;17
Speaker 3
Yeah. In time that I knew him.

00;38;17;20 - 00;38;28;19
Speaker 4
But I get that we'll probably ten feet eight feet across to three well guarded down there.

00;38;28;21 - 00;38;29;29
Speaker 5
Which were thinking.

00;38;30;14 - 00;38;47;20
Speaker 1
yeah. And I got down. Yeah. And you're talking about draining it today.

00;38;47;25 - 00;38;49;29
Speaker 5
You know where I go tomorrow.

00;38;50;01 - 00;38;50;13
Speaker 4
In the morning.

00;38;50;14 - 00;38;52;29
Speaker 5
I don't remember that. Anyhow.

00;38;53;02 - 00;38;56;22
Speaker 4
There's nobody right in the prime of tomorrow and.

00;38;57;07 - 00;39;01;18
Speaker 1
that's right. The they're not bringing in the mail now to try to that.

00;39;01;20 - 00;39;02;16
Speaker 3
Pride month, you know.

00;39;02;20 - 00;39;03;25
Speaker 1
So it won't be this third.

00;39;03;28 - 00;39;11;19
Speaker 4
No I don't think so. And we will.

00;39;11;21 - 00;39;12;09
Speaker 1
Get out per.

00;39;12;10 - 00;39;16;01
Speaker 4
Fine day there after.

00;39;16;03 - 00;39;19;14
Speaker 5
Didn't sound like this and we burn for a day or two.

00;39;19;17 - 00;39;22;29
Speaker 3
Not declaring no.

00;39;23;01 - 00;39;25;00
Speaker 4
Rain the night.

00;39;25;02 - 00;39;28;17
Speaker 3
Clearing right.

00;39;28;20 - 00;39;30;16
Speaker 5
It takes us on our team.

00;39;30;16 - 00;39;30;28
Speaker 3
Like you get.

00;39;30;28 - 00;39;39;15
Speaker 4
Heard. The theory that these branches coming through right behind of.

00;39;39;17 - 00;39;41;14
Speaker 1
How long it takes more than.

00;39;41;17 - 00;39;43;05
Speaker 5
An hour here.

00;39;43;08 - 00;40;02;27
Speaker 4
But it Yeah I drove them well up there were a couple of said Yeah. Down them them.

00;40;03;05 - 00;40;12;17
Speaker 5
I didn't really expect it to track you know I really have some good pictures. My favorite of the trip to me they were important.

00;40;12;19 - 00;40;19;08
Speaker 4
You don't fool around on them. All right? I'm fine. I can tell you. He down by, They'll come right at you, you know.

00;40;19;09 - 00;40;20;11
Speaker 1
But then again, I.

00;40;20;12 - 00;40;24;09
Speaker 5
Think we can have poster board or.

00;40;24;11 - 00;40;27;28
Speaker 4
You know.

00;40;28;00 - 00;40;33;18
Speaker 3
And that's funny. My phone and my down there on.

00;40;33;20 - 00;40;42;16
Speaker 1
That one has really big one. They both are ensuring that when they get.

00;40;42;18 - 00;40;50;17
Speaker 4
What did you know that not a bigger than you think when you get out and look at that go to the so.

00;40;50;19 - 00;40;52;10
Speaker 1
What did you get those.

00;40;52;12 - 00;40;53;14
Speaker 4
On the map and I.

00;40;53;18 - 00;41;02;22
Speaker 1
Don't that that.

00;41;02;24 - 00;41;03;26
Speaker 3
And that how.

00;41;03;26 - 00;41;09;02
Speaker 4
And might be ignored blow up.

00;41;09;04 - 00;41;17;29
Speaker 5
Well we're all we are all and you keep regretting afterward that we haven't gotten to like right we don't know.

00;41;18;00 - 00;41;21;09
Speaker 4
I did it down the road and everything to do it with.

00;41;21;11 - 00;41;31;03
Speaker 5
I knew nothing about that. She knew more. But we should have gotten a light, you know, back of that. A highlight. Yeah. So it would have come up.

00;41;31;06 - 00;41;38;12
Speaker 1
Well, yeah, There's two ways you could do that. See that? One of the beauties of both these photographs is the black background.

00;41;38;18 - 00;41;44;27
Speaker 5
Yeah, well, this was a piece of black material he was using hands over him.

00;41;44;29 - 00;41;56;05
Speaker 1
But you could have had a light. Yes, over in the side just kind of come and just highlight more. And then the orange would have been highlighted, you know? Well, there's something you know.

00;41;56;07 - 00;42;08;26
Speaker 4
You don't. That tone on my black background, you can already make the other part of the head out there to get around and look at the whole the whole mouth there.

00;42;08;28 - 00;42;09;26
Speaker 1
Yeah I noticed.

00;42;09;29 - 00;42;11;26
Speaker 3
Yeah. What name the blue.

00;42;11;26 - 00;42;19;07
Speaker 4
Light and all the stones they put down there a dark sheet.

00;42;19;09 - 00;42;20;25
Speaker 1
Who did the taxidermy work.

00;42;20;27 - 00;42;29;29
Speaker 4
John and Daniel Jones.

00;42;30;02 - 00;42;39;07
Speaker 1
On your did you coming into the runway, did you work at that sort of piecemeal or did you do that all pretty much at one time?

00;42;39;10 - 00;43;07;09
Speaker 4
Well, we had a blind here and that placed the water out on the strip. And he was also one of the head bootlegger during prohibition. And but he did quite a lot of work here. There was an old it there and here you got kind of build up and and but when I take it out I went further up the creek so get more gravity on it and then come in the old legend and on down.

00;43;07;11 - 00;43;34;21
Speaker 4
And then I cut that out along the upper end there, creeping down along the side. There and, but I'd, I'd work community care at the high water line down the high water on some descriptive thing, you know some and I figured I'd go down on the cocktail. By the end of that I turn the water in the deck.

00;43;34;23 - 00;43;43;09
Speaker 1
So usually that would be you're talking about the second high water and you turn the water on what, the metal or the end of July? Yeah.

00;43;43;11 - 00;44;15;24
Speaker 4
We've got a and I think that I had turned it on in the spring a time or two when the Greek with the low we get didn't get the necessary 77 good but that's scrap already quite a bunch of you know that I know How about ground on there don't take anything that that that smothered him. I thought his mother would apparently have I never did see the center of the strip.

00;44;15;24 - 00;44;46;05
Speaker 4
You know, just both sides out now. We'll probably leave 30 put her on. That's all we ever use anymore. But, Andy, you know, I'll come there and get Niger. It will, you know, and then I'd, I'd get put down there all around before and, and move aside and knock a little out here and there sometimes even had oak on the more more two or three round you get close in on it.

00;44;46;08 - 00;44;54;10
Speaker 1
Like a star and then.

00;44;55;26 - 00;44;59;03
Unknown
yeah, why don't we you.

00;44;59;05 - 00;45;10;18
Speaker 1
We're going down. She's the picture down gorge where I was. I don't know what the lights know. It could be cut up tomorrow and, and be worth it, you know. So we'll see. Well.

00;45;10;20 - 00;45;16;14
Speaker 4
That's hard to tell. We'll both be darned. Nine out of the forecast, I think, that night.

00;45;16;17 - 00;45;22;21
Speaker 1
But when that you've they get much farther down here then it is it clear out.

00;45;22;23 - 00;46;00;11
Speaker 4
No gonna getting breakthrough anywhere you know we get down here it's that area right and I was working here in Boise and upon you and it'll be roughing up anyplace and then getting in from Chicago. Why that rain drop this way toward the top four. It'll stop in solid, but generally more open this way. Then her kids, either one, the other up from Simon or Cal.

00;46;00;13 - 00;46;05;26
Speaker 5
When you fly in, do you come down the middle or up the middle for come in?

00;46;05;29 - 00;46;37;29
Speaker 1
If for some reason I come over into the upper country and maybe stop off at North Star or Running Creek, then when I come over, I come over and we'll come over at the head and Magruder there, you know, the opposite way, and just drop right over. And then I come up the middle for you. But like yesterday we came in and I came over hard steer east of Greenville at the South Fork at Clearwater, right over Cheney Grove, just a little bit east of Dixie, right over Chamberlain.

00;46;38;02 - 00;46;41;16
Speaker 4
Down the No, we can you go out there? We go.

00;46;41;16 - 00;46;42;14
Speaker 3
Down and then right.

00;46;42;14 - 00;46;57;28
Speaker 4
On up the valley in Missoula. We had gotten the demo quite a bit. And one time Kenny Rob brought us what he called the background, and that was on the other side of the range.

00;46;58;01 - 00;47;00;17
Speaker 1
You mean over on the west side? Well.

00;47;00;19 - 00;47;01;15
Speaker 4
Yeah.

00;47;01;18 - 00;47;03;26
Speaker 5

00;47;25;18 - 00;47;26;16
Speaker 1
Right?

00;47;26;18 - 00;47;32;03
Speaker 4
And I didn't get Mark. And those aren't mental training. You don't get Narcan in the pilot in.

00;47;32;06 - 00;47;46;07
Speaker 1
Boys in Flying. So tomorrow you don't know. You just go, I'm on the whoever comes in then fly out or.

Speaker 1
Out I say.

00;47;49;23 - 00;47;51;22
Speaker 4
You know, we keep our contacts out there.

00;47;51;22 - 00;48;01;07
Speaker 5
All I go, Are you We are. We might go to my again. It depends upon how they do from here.

00;48;01;10 - 00;48;03;02
Speaker 1
I think.

00;48;03;05 - 00;48;05;15
Speaker 5
When you go.

00;48;05;18 - 00;48;07;10
Speaker 1

00;48;07;12 - 00;48;08;15
Speaker 5
Yeah.

00;48;08;17 - 00;48;24;27
Speaker 1
Well cancels is coming in and he may have one other or maybe a couple of people working and he was talking about coming in tomorrow afternoon. So we may leave when he arrives or maybe just before another word.

00;48;24;27 - 00;48;27;23
Speaker 4
You figured he'd get that you get out there.

00;48;27;26 - 00;48;54;22
Speaker 1
Smart. Yeah. Or we may just go on over into the into the cell, but we then stop and visit with Carolyn for one. But if possible. But maybe tomorrow or later this afternoon to take a couple of portrait shots of the crew sitting there. I think of the we could even got a picture of that for you later on in.

00;48;54;22 - 00;48;57;04
Speaker 5
That where we I take horrible pictures.

00;48;57;04 - 00;48;58;28
Speaker 1
Well good.

00;48;59;01 - 00;49;00;16
Speaker 4
Yeah and stay in.

00;49;00;16 - 00;49;02;15
Speaker 1
Iraq and here like that.

00;49;02;17 - 00;49;05;02
Speaker 4
You're not sure we have one.

00;49;05;05 - 00;49;11;00
Speaker 1
And we like that. I don't know if the college has any shots of you in the house here. And especially I.

00;49;11;00 - 00;49;14;26
Speaker 5
Don't think I'm here. Not in the house. I don't know.

00;49;14;28 - 00;49;19;08
Speaker 1
In fact, I haven't seen I haven't seen that many pictures of I don't know.

00;49;19;08 - 00;49;21;20
Speaker 5
Where you're right, going on.

00;49;21;22 - 00;49;22;26
Speaker 1
The Argonaut.

00;49;22;28 - 00;49;38;08
Speaker 5
A vague and vague. And I know you well in the some of these pictures, we look just like farm cattle, but we're in. That is the story of the.

00;49;38;10 - 00;49;57;01
Speaker 1
Well, I tell you what, we got a tripod and got a real good camera and I have a fairly decent camera. We could take some shots and then we have a real good darkroom at the college and we can have them up next time we meet. Whether you can look at some contact prints and if there's something you like, we can blow them up inside you.

00;49;57;03 - 00;50;32;01
Speaker 1
That would be really nice. In fact, Dave was talking last night. The I don't know whether you've seen it, the college or the university has a publication. They call it contact. And it is that a monthly I think it's by monthly right now. And they they've got a new editor and she's very interested in getting feature articles especially anything about wilderness and primitive areas and also the Taylor Ranch.

00;50;32;01 - 00;50;51;02
Speaker 1
And and I'd like some time I'd like to sit with you and talk with you more, and maybe we can work up a real nice feature story about you being back here in just about the ranch and, and do an article around around you, too, because I think that's where that's where the story is. I think there's a real good story there.

00;50;51;02 - 00;51;07;06
Speaker 1
And, you know, it's I know that the university would be very much in favor of getting publicity like that. And it's just a real interest to people over there due to our kind of a household where you around college, especially.

00;51;07;09 - 00;51;26;19
Speaker 4
When you and we have people do that. And I think that what we have done here or you know, we've got various periods, my experiences we've had and so on, but I'm sure they in the way of that more interactive reading than some of these are public.

00;51;26;22 - 00;51;38;18
Speaker 1
Right in the way we work it is that I would work up a draft and we would get together and you could go over it and we make sure of accuracy, that sort of thing. So we all be satisfied before it was ever published.

00;51;38;20 - 00;51;45;22
Speaker 5
And you know, when you think that the whole House was down, I had to write no farm, you.

00;51;45;28 - 00;51;46;21
Speaker 4
Know, part.

00;51;46;23 - 00;51;48;01
Speaker 5
Harmony.

00;51;48;03 - 00;51;52;08
Speaker 4
And then have part of it. And then they all come out of one.

00;51;52;15 - 00;51;54;01
Speaker 1
this is something people don't realize.

00;51;54;01 - 00;52;02;29
Speaker 5
And they realize that every every now either. Yes. Chances are it was carefully crafted.

00;52;02;29 - 00;52;13;29
Speaker 1
So we were admiring the cabin last night, the work. And it's really amazing. And you match the logs and then.

00;52;14;02 - 00;52;42;00
Speaker 4
Well, when we when we were operating this and had that cabin and out of doing the guiding and about one packer and that's all we had, we done the cooking and everything but 800 we'd take it home or, and our game deck was way above average and we've been.

00;52;42;00 - 00;52;42;26
Speaker 1
And.

00;52;42;28 - 00;53;02;14
Speaker 4
We've been on the top outfitter in, in the Yukon and in Alaska, nine in the top and up there and British Columbia and none of them running up that compared to what we ran here when we included that cabin with the showers.

00;53;02;15 - 00;53;04;18
Speaker 1
And and people coming here.

00;53;04;19 - 00;53;11;01
Speaker 5
But you know, I didn't hear that, you know, that they could just in our sleeping bag.

00;53;11;04 - 00;53;30;18
Speaker 4
They'd come out on the hill and here we knew they were coming north. They had no no. When we were coming off that water shower, water hot. No wonder we got to repeat business. The caravan business right now is repeat from our operation here.

00;53;30;21 - 00;53;31;17
Speaker 5
Well, a.

00;53;31;21 - 00;53;32;10
Speaker 4
Lot of a lot.

00;53;32;11 - 00;53;42;17
Speaker 5
Of like we did here. It was fun to do and it was fine. We had a walk hour.

00;53;42;17 - 00;54;23;02
Speaker 4
We the first couple that ever went into that cabin, we didn't panic them. The oil is hardly dry on the floor and they looked pretty plush. Well, they were too far back here, and that's been a good many years to go. And he he rode and wanted to come just on a fishing trip and so on. And and then we got another letter from and said that if we had the proper accommodation that he would like to bring it right and we rode back to shore in that we had and, and you know, and he walked into that cabin and he said, you know, I did not do that.

00;54;23;02 - 00;54;30;24
Speaker 4
The damn liar when I walked in here. And they never.

00;54;30;26 - 00;54;37;17
Speaker 1
When did you get you get the idea of selling ranch to the university for as a research center.

00;54;37;20 - 00;55;11;22
Speaker 4
Well, Mark wrote that one note we've been arrested on rape their proposition and then don't be carried forward with it. And we told him we want the that we were then arrested and apparently here and we would interact and see the place maintained their present status. We weren't interested in selling this in California or somebody to go and put a bunch of cabins in here and go all out on something here because we want to part of it.

00;55;11;25 - 00;55;13;29
Speaker 3
We wish to come and go.

00;55;14;01 - 00;55;37;25
Speaker 4
And that was that was one reason that we dealt with the university. And so far it was a few reverses. It worked out pretty good. But we you know, we've got to always minimize the reverses. We don't we don't taking them anymore. We get one. We get eliminate.

00;55;37;27 - 00;55;38;29
Speaker 5
But you so you can't do.

00;55;38;29 - 00;55;47;00
Speaker 4
That, right? Don't they've got a pretty good idea,

00;55;47;02 - 00;56;04;29
Speaker 5
Bracket came along in our lives when we were average 46 and Jeff was 50, and there was, you know, just when you here, you're gone. You're all you don't have anything more to do. But we did. We were so busy and worked so hard to you that.

00;56;05;01 - 00;56;08;03
Speaker 1
We forgot all about it.

00;56;08;05 - 00;56;22;06
Speaker 4
Yet before we got in the paper newspaper about how to operate a let's go. So Dorothy read that and got we got ideas, you know, about our operating.

00;56;22;08 - 00;56;33;16
Speaker 5
Rights and how to get and I would go in the Boise paper the semi we came here might get it down it's one of our needs and I've.

00;56;33;16 - 00;56;36;28
Speaker 1
Been told you were born in Idaho is that right And what part about.

00;56;37;00 - 00;56;48;03
Speaker 5
An amalgamation that the small town where under people that were born your people when I was there and your people now never came.

00;56;48;06 - 00;56;49;17
Speaker 1
Within.

00;56;49;17 - 00;56;57;02
Speaker 5
30 miles west of the bill Beverly in eastern Iowa. Yeah.

00;56;57;04 - 00;57;07;02
Speaker 1
I'm from Minnesota. We used to go campaign in Iowa all the time down south southwest of Des Moines and the Creston.

00;57;07;04 - 00;57;15;00
Speaker 5
I guess, where people were living in this little town on the other end, 20 miles away at Manchester.

00;57;15;02 - 00;57;16;09
Speaker 1
Was when I was on my own.

00;57;16;15 - 00;57;20;20
Speaker 5
Yes. You are reading me from western Iowa.

00;57;20;20 - 00;57;30;10
Speaker 1
I'm not sure. Not very popular in that place.

00;57;30;13 - 00;58;02;19
Speaker 5
Well, after I went back, I might be prosecuted to go up and my cousin took me was driving around within a short distance of the little town. I can't imagine what my father thought. He had to leave for this beautiful country and a lot of Indian War to act up and never had a million more across the country.

00;58;02;21 - 00;58;03;25
Speaker 5
Nearby.

00;58;03;27 - 00;58;16;21
Speaker 1
Very much Southern. I was still back on the way. It was in the thirties. I think that's when people came out. A lot of that's why I still have the stories of the bus driver. Yeah, very much like.

00;58;16;24 - 00;58;18;05
Speaker 5
Some of these movies they made.

00;58;18;05 - 00;58;19;14
Speaker 1
You find that.

00;58;19;17 - 00;59;58;09
