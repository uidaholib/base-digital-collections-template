00;00;00;00 - 00;00;19;06
Speaker 1
You've been a great man and would. But I don't want to be in the club. I don't want to go to those.

00;00;19;07 - 00;00;23;13
Speaker 2
That trail's still been, you know.

00;00;23;15 - 00;00;50;07
Speaker 1
Gone. It is up to the top from the other side. The bit that I can go up and I can take working up. But the last place you don't stay with the train. It goes in the right moment. You know where you're going. Even you can screw around and pick it up back and forth and forget about the lodgepole man, though the nut climbed up there wide and it'll be a big pine tree down across here and there.

00;00;50;09 - 00;00;54;04
Speaker 1
But it hadn't been cut out to my knowledge at all.

00;00;54;11 - 00;00;57;11
Speaker 3
Did it have the old horse or blade or single blazer?

00;00;57;14 - 00;00;59;23
Speaker 2
Yeah, Yeah. They're bottom.

00;00;59;25 - 00;01;00;11
Speaker 1
Already up to.

00;01;00;11 - 00;01;07;13
Speaker 3
Be. So that was really an early, early trail.

00;01;07;15 - 00;01;22;26
Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah. There's no sun down here. And look over my shoulder over here. Yeah, it's a university. it is? Yeah, It's like a pretty old.

00;01;22;28 - 00;01;35;04
Speaker 1
Well, I think of been from Oak Grove out there. I've got about a half a case of a good powder. And can you. A lot of time to get a hold of me or I'll.

00;01;35;04 - 00;01;47;28
Speaker 2
Go blowing and. And then I do a little work here and there and I'm do a lot of work. Real quick. You might not get over the look.

00;01;47;29 - 00;01;55;12
Speaker 1
But know this powder now, you know, it brought that differently and it don't feel bitter.

00;01;55;12 - 00;02;00;20
Speaker 2
Make the old poplar to freeze in the freeze like.

00;02;00;22 - 00;02;05;01
Speaker 1
No no.

00;02;05;04 - 00;02;06;28
Speaker 2
I ran into the past of that stuff one.

00;02;06;28 - 00;02;15;12
Unknown
Time in South Central Utah and it was all you could see.

00;02;15;19 - 00;02;16;28
Speaker 2
The thing is saturated.

00;02;16;28 - 00;02;23;01
Unknown
And it was right next to the road and somebody coming.

00;02;23;01 - 00;02;34;20
Speaker 2
On mountain in their jeep, they bounce out of the rough and the chance hit the stuff, you know? Well, you know, you never know.

00;02;34;21 - 00;02;35;10
Speaker 1
And I didn't.

00;02;35;11 - 00;02;36;18
Speaker 2
Get out of it.

00;02;36;20 - 00;02;48;05
Speaker 1
And I'll do it about but dynamite myself. Is that all? No carbonated water. But when you get that tap next to it and then you.

00;02;48;05 - 00;03;06;13
Speaker 2
Want to like that, we end up big enough that happens in the creek and to raise the curtain apparently for seismographic work, we picked it up very, very carefully and took it all in the sand and burned it.

00;03;06;15 - 00;03;08;20
Speaker 1
I built this section of trail.

00;03;08;23 - 00;03;10;17
Speaker 2
And they're going to drill down here through the.

00;03;10;17 - 00;03;36;25
Speaker 1
Range of 4000 feet of it. And blowed down the hole. Pick that up down there. The guard went to Wal-Mart and checked it way up there, you know, spread out about for it to get hanging up there. Made it a bit out of it. It was probably 75 feet gone. And it was really dangerous. They were not.

00;03;36;28 - 00;03;37;27
Speaker 2
Good.

00;03;37;29 - 00;03;42;21
Speaker 1
At that drill. Get the better of it. And I love up by when I went off.

00;03;42;23 - 00;03;47;22
Speaker 2
To where.

00;03;47;24 - 00;03;54;28
Speaker 3
Would that be? The man would he be? And he wouldn't be able to bring him in there.

00;03;55;00 - 00;04;05;23
Speaker 1
Why are they? That may be boys coming in.

00;04;05;25 - 00;04;10;25
Unknown
You were to find out. Yeah.

00;04;10;28 - 00;04;15;08

Speaker 2
Over here.

00;04;21;09 - 00;04;50;17
Speaker 1
Well, we set it up pretty little bit, you know, in here.

00;04;50;20 - 00;04;58;17
Speaker 3
What would you do on these floors? Would you say anything but everything on them? Yeah, well, you know that. You know you're going to get pretty handy.

00;04;58;20 - 00;05;06;05
Speaker 1
Yeah. I don't know. We've been getting quite a bit of air in our interior. Anywhere in there.

00;05;06;05 - 00;05;10;13
Speaker 2
I kind of knew how to do it. Now, let's just look for exterior.

00;05;10;17 - 00;05;12;10
Speaker 1
Yeah.

00;05;14;20 - 00;05;17;17
Speaker 2
nobody bark over there.

00;05;18;16 - 00;05;25;12
Speaker 1
they've got plan B up there. Yeah, but make that up and it maybe get by pulling in and come.

00;05;25;13 - 00;05;30;00
Speaker 3
By the gear. Have anything to do with Don Schneider?

00;05;30;02 - 00;05;34;03
Unknown
Election Limited? No. If he came over on.

00;05;34;03 - 00;05;39;12
Speaker 3
The fairway quite a bit there, it was probably a co-op.

00;05;39;15 - 00;05;47;15
Unknown
You know. But he's from Boise. That veterinarian. Yeah. And they would come in the Red River and had a.

00;05;47;15 - 00;05;58;18
Speaker 3
Big mass with them. I know. And they it was just like a commercial outfit and all respect and a good ranch. Some of the the outfitters over.

00;05;58;18 - 00;06;04;22
Unknown
There, you know, they just didn't know what to do you know. Well on the only way to.

00;06;04;25 - 00;06;15;09
Speaker 1
Regulate the take on this game is through out there to not make the bank a lot better than not five by overnight here you there get into what you out here and get out.

00;06;15;11 - 00;06;18;10
Speaker 2
But that's pretty well under control now.

00;06;18;13 - 00;06;20;00
Speaker 1
But you're going.

00;06;20;02 - 00;06;22;13
Speaker 5
To during the weekend.

00;06;22;20 - 00;06;42;00
Speaker 3
I don't know when I took off And so you are you know, I see people around at all know they didn't have time to get out. But just as I take off and I made a short bank, the last one right down the street below and they was acting it down downstream, you know, so he guys to just picked up the go down there and then I assume I would be too far down first.

00;06;42;02 - 00;06;43;17
Speaker 3
Then he would be going.

00;06;43;19 - 00;06;49;05
Speaker 1
Feeling off and go Can he go that boat. Great. He goes up there, get a little green.

00;06;49;07 - 00;06;55;11
Speaker 3
Unless we get as I this is I put off bank you know you can bank upstream here and he's right.

00;06;55;13 - 00;06;56;13
Speaker 1
Below the big guard.

00;06;56;22 - 00;07;01;12
Speaker 3
yeah. Just right straight below that. Know where you take off and just turn right there.

00;07;01;14 - 00;07;13;08
Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah. Well I'd be below the management below the left there. Well they'd be, I would know him, they pick them up there on the creek then later went up on the bar and picked them up.

00;07;13;10 - 00;07;15;15
Speaker 5
Make it a walk down.

00;07;15;18 - 00;07;21;15
Unknown
I, I don't have any idea. I get that cradle and.

00;07;21;15 - 00;07;26;00
Speaker 1
Then pretty there where it all worked out would be river that.

00;07;26;00 - 00;07;32;06
Unknown
Record the stream there you take three strike across to get him on the bar.

00;07;32;14 - 00;07;56;12
Speaker 1
yeah they made that's always been important proposition There were we grew we grew up there. Well they all do and the cradle right. Be right back I told your bar what they call even born. And they used to be a secondary lookout or a creek and that's why they built the trail up there. But it's a, well, good background, a good trail.

00;07;56;14 - 00;08;02;14
Speaker 1
And then we were on back in victory after that.

00;08;02;17 - 00;08;08;19
Unknown
So I wouldn't know the best way to patrol the bar. Well.

00;08;08;22 - 00;08;11;22
Speaker 1
Yeah, but no, nowhere to go. And they're going to get.

00;08;11;24 - 00;08;15;18
Speaker 2
Up.

00;08;15;20 - 00;08;19;01
Speaker 3
At mile.

00;08;19;04 - 00;08;22;10
Speaker 2
You know. Where are they going to do it? Yeah.

00;08;22;10 - 00;08;55;22
Speaker 1
What I was going to say was that when I first started on in here, there's several outfits now outside the column. Maybe 40 had a heart and some hunter and they get that they get like that or country over like people up there and and go back and then they leave their that is nothing but that that and we had a telephone that what do you call that partner that we like you in here and that thing and then they come in and say, this ain't got a dog, here we are.

00;08;55;24 - 00;09;11;26
Speaker 1
We get you had a heart and taken good care of a and they come in here and when they go out to that bed down here, that whole lower and they're up in the Golden Creek and they put a stop to it, they have come in.

00;09;11;28 - 00;09;16;19
Unknown
And they come in.

00;09;16;21 - 00;09;22;08
Speaker 5
Is infirmities the they are they don't care now and I fine.

00;09;22;08 - 00;09;24;16
Speaker 3
Tonight I don't know.

00;09;24;18 - 00;09;34;12
Speaker 1
Well it would be well anyhow attempting to find out and if they're put on that kind of a day long band might get better knowing well in Wrangler one would hope so.

00;09;34;14 - 00;09;36;24
Speaker 3
They know that they flew in.

00;09;36;26 - 00;09;51;26
Speaker 1
With they on where they get dumped on or off on your bar. Well that they're going down across the middle more but I didn't care for it but it blind beat their territory or somebody help me out with now doctor had it.

00;09;51;26 - 00;09;54;16
Speaker 5
For a long time.

00;09;54;19 - 00;10;06;08
Speaker 1
Now back in Pocatello and I approached them on time one No you on the parents that we'd like to have it for us to take the one to go down there.

00;10;06;10 - 00;10;15;13
Unknown
And they were pretty low there and with you and even turned them my understanding told.

00;10;15;14 - 00;10;25;16

A body out you can, you can turn your right with you can give. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00;10;25;18 - 00;10;36;13
Speaker 3
When I take off in their day I looked across and there's it looked like an exploratory hole know right across it was for the light blue vein goes down. Yeah. What's the history on that.

00;10;36;16 - 00;10;39;23
Speaker 1
I think the natural case it is Yeah.

00;10;39;25 - 00;10;45;14
Unknown
About maybe even made and you know Roger where I never.

00;10;45;14 - 00;10;50;19
Speaker 1
Thought it worthwhile to go up there and look at overlook little Caribbean but yeah it does. Yeah.

00;10;50;22 - 00;10;52;14
Speaker 3
I mean I didn't really look it over.

00;10;52;14 - 00;10;58;04
Unknown
But it just when I turned around looking right at it, I wondered.

00;10;58;06 - 00;11;07;26
Speaker 3
You said you had a plastic thing. You have one thing down here. Too much color or.

00;11;07;29 - 00;11;34;21
Speaker 1
I got to. I've got no particular color outside of what was in the general Big Creek area on the one on big rig down here. I've kept them over the year Mark the Newton Valley, they had the in fact part of the official did me all that when I came back he that is pocket.

00;11;34;28 - 00;11;36;20
Speaker 2
Certain person that.

00;11;36;23 - 00;11;57;23
Speaker 1
Going I'm going in to go in the beautiful basement and you see that beaten over there and in about my acre and we were on the what had my claim of that and I said well are I know I couldn't work on and I while I was gone and I couldn't record it, but I presume under my.

00;11;57;26 - 00;11;58;17
Speaker 3
Coverage, you know.

00;11;58;17 - 00;12;25;11
Speaker 1
I would be entitled to that privilege. But I said, I'll get three bottom. So I get around the republic and I regard my work every year, every year and all levels there and all at that inaccurate rate. Go And then in clay. Clay and back then right there in a big boulder limestone field. Yes, they were down at a terminal of a glacier or something.

00;12;25;13 - 00;12;25;27
Speaker 3
Yeah.

00;12;26;00 - 00;12;48;01
Speaker 1
And then one report from the Geological Survey I got was in Spokane, came in. Why? They made the same evaluation on it. But it with that level, it wouldn't justify it. But what I could get if I did the bedrock might be a different. Probably.

00;12;48;04 - 00;12;55;27
Speaker 3
But that the black thing. And that wasn't anywhere at all. Or is that just black that Well.

00;12;55;29 - 00;13;11;20
Speaker 1
I don't know if they really detonated, but I sent my equipment a nickel right along. I think I sent that about three. Now I feel the same.

00;13;11;23 - 00;13;21;20
Speaker 3
With there's a couple of outcrops over in the shell way here and most of them are long dikes, you know, and they're similar.

00;13;21;23 - 00;13;22;11
Speaker 1
You know.

00;13;22;16 - 00;13;28;11
Unknown
In some of that. I guess some of it's been good with one fella. He's been back in there thinking.

00;13;28;11 - 00;13;31;13
Speaker 3
That boy.

00;13;31;15 - 00;13;34;19
Unknown
He's an outfitter over there. And I know in.

00;13;34;21 - 00;13;46;10
Speaker 3
Got knowing real well over the years you know one man Yeah. And you didn't know what to do. You know that you liked the country so much. And even if he sold it out there and still spend most of the time back there.

00;13;46;13 - 00;13;53;00
Unknown
You know, and you get very limited.

00;13;53;02 - 00;14;07;22
Speaker 1
Well, that's a really the only reason that I that I found it. Another reason is that you can put in about the motor vehicle and take out of a runway and drive about a 5% rate.

00;14;07;24 - 00;14;09;05
Speaker 3
I saw that.

00;14;09;07 - 00;14;16;21
Speaker 1
Yeah. And I've got dropped all rode on. I remember the 180 in there and we'd go down a couple of days.

00;14;16;25 - 00;14;18;03
Speaker 5
Directly from.

00;14;18;06 - 00;14;18;29
Speaker 3
So Yeah.

00;14;18;29 - 00;14;37;02
Speaker 1
Yeah I know that way on of airfield in those bar if they build your bar blade up and down the creek and it subject that they were watching a fading wind that way and you'd never have any wind trouble on that side again. You never got all blocked off.

00;14;37;04 - 00;14;39;06
Speaker 3
When I saw it.

00;14;39;08 - 00;14;50;07
Speaker 1
Well it did not move. It brought about by a good 1600 feet there and you wanted to blast a little farther. You could get three or four more hundred.

00;14;50;09 - 00;14;55;09
Speaker 3
1600 or with that my age, that that's equivalent to about 3000.

00;14;55;09 - 00;15;05;27
Speaker 1
But when might. Yeah. That's all you'd ever need That and the cleared for takeoff you can just bail out on nothing you know.

00;15;05;29 - 00;15;10;05
Speaker 5
But I pulled a good irrigated it.

00;15;10;07 - 00;15;28;10
Speaker 1
Yeah. Day in you can see where it's been or getting back the your neck are still there and I found I found a water right on it and at the same time that I filed on all of it I'm one out of good good.

00;15;28;13 - 00;15;35;02
Speaker 3
And they, they give it to you on that. yeah. So you've still got that. yeah.

00;15;35;04 - 00;15;41;13
Unknown
And, but they would.

00;15;41;13 - 00;16;10;01
Speaker 1
Know. They grow right up on one side of it over there. You can go up there and still and they use irrigated and cut the hay with the side there for the water really tightened down. And you probably have we had ah that's all I ever noticed why I'd be at that little bit of hay there. You know that item through and there you were then back in the rock field off of it.

00;16;10;03 - 00;16;25;12
Unknown
So you know, I've been down there, but I haven't been to that beautiful thing. We're going to.

00;16;25;14 - 00;17;06;12
Speaker 1
Have that down about I think 25 feet through that clay. If I started in right up and went down for a year work and I stepped out of that and went down again thinking maybe eventually I'd if they were better, but they're not doing, I just stayed in that straight clay and I would go up and there's been the a little Crookwell black band there and that's, that's a mental bearing the the black that were quarter in Newton ball of clay in your hand.

00;17;06;14 - 00;17;11;08
Unknown
The funny deal.

00;17;11;11 - 00;17;16;03
Speaker 3
I wonder if you could you think it might be worth a hoot for Potter.

00;17;16;06 - 00;17;18;29
Speaker 5
I don't know I don't know that you can.

00;17;19;01 - 00;17;21;21
Speaker 2
Boy you're kind of blue.

00;17;21;24 - 00;17;23;15
Speaker 1
And a blue gray looking play.

00;17;23;20 - 00;17;25;29
Speaker 3
With certain the same colors in that big.

00;17;26;01 - 00;17;28;00
Speaker 1
Band. Yeah, yeah.

00;17;28;02 - 00;17;31;07
Speaker 3
Yeah. It. It about the same strike or the same.

00;17;31;10 - 00;17;35;06
Speaker 1
Can you tell. Well it probes I would say about.

00;17;35;09 - 00;17;36;00
Speaker 3
It's pretty steep.

00;17;36;06 - 00;18;03;14
Speaker 1
In about 1 to 1 where that clay it, it is kind of a little point picked out there and in great big boulder appeared never a bigger diagram there you looking at. you know and be a lot but in I'd blown a great big boulder right out of the top of it and made a hole I get the look and the crop and I cleaned it all out and it didn't quite and then I get it right on just step out the middle of that and go down.

00;18;03;14 - 00;18;32;29
Speaker 1
And I progressively went down there like I thought it probably went down then I think they're at least in like and I'm just up and down about five feet in time and that's the way I but it clear to you and I've got a big it that's my old bow but I don't know how I get on that but I you know I like good place they know they didn't.

00;18;33;01 - 00;18;35;11
Speaker 3
They just losing that at all or.

00;18;35;14 - 00;18;38;05
Speaker 1
No but the creek right there.

00;18;38;05 - 00;18;53;18
Speaker 3
Yeah yeah. you think would any of Dave lose his papers, clarify whether or not he was in the Spanish-American War?

00;18;53;21 - 00;19;07;09
Speaker 1
I don't think I have anything that pertains to and I just don't know. And I can't recollect that he ever told me what he did about every other metric.

00;19;07;09 - 00;19;40;06
Speaker 3
I'm alone in going over the correspondence there. There was a deal I was of around between. I guess that was it. Well we've seen Erickson pot you know and then there was an instance where all it said was the graduate student was up in one of those camps and he said something that is a higher that whether they led many sheep around, you know, and said, well, that's funny.

00;19;40;06 - 00;19;40;22

00;21;19;05 - 00;21;31;03
Speaker 3
I remember the picture, you know, and he said that he was working on sheep and and it triggered and I just wondered if it was that, you know, because there were no names mentioned in the Correspond and no, you know, Well.

00;21;31;06 - 00;21;32;02
Speaker 5
They didn't have to.

That blew me out of place and walked into in the woods and camp and yet making remark there wasn't any heat in the corner of the 800 bed in there. But the download I think don't you take a look through the scope and page. Well the well where they did water but it was clear out of their out of reach what Yeah.

Well they wait around maybe a couple of weeks, you get a good big snow and I country, I mean birds start breaking up and popping out onto these grassy points and then you start the out the air down there in Green Bay.

00;22;27;15 - 00;22;51;24

Now that's where they are with them. That matter right here, this big basin across here. When I think the June graph in there, down in October, that hot methane dirty head out right here, right, right now. And I got up there and with 100 and we went around the mountain here and come down on top of up to a they were, they were going out.

Speaker 1
But the no going feet now bring them up the all the green been there and then down an old swamp and that road and they don't like that so they're getting a bad deal.

00;23;04;23 - 00;23;12;21
Speaker 5
One time just the day before I'm thinking of roasting about them now you know burnt right in the town. Got right to.

00;23;12;21 - 00;23;13;25
Speaker 3
The spot like over you.

00;23;13;25 - 00;23;19;02

Speaker 5
In the summer camp.

00;23;33;03 - 00;23;50;13
Speaker 1
In the summertime and a gallon of your own water, I ran over there and it felt turned around but didn't inhale. And we're here and.

00;23;50;15 - 00;24;07;24
Speaker 3
And see I let me the first part of that one tape I didn't get only the second side, but somehow we got off the question of either who was gored by the bull or who was in the battle with the bull with the hay night.

00;24;07;26 - 00;24;08;20
Speaker 1
Well, we found it.

00;24;08;27 - 00;24;11;21
Speaker 5
Well, we.

00;24;11;24 - 00;24;25;24
Speaker 1
Started with Abel. Abel? Yeah. And that that was the Bellingham run. And we got one night back in the day, you know, by then, he fell heir to this important olive branch up here on the upper end.

00;24;25;29 - 00;24;26;27
Speaker 3
Now.

00;24;27;00 - 00;24;36;00
Speaker 5
I mean, I think you're wrong on that, How is that section up there? You know, I'm in Bellingham.

00;24;36;01 - 00;24;38;15
Speaker 1
Well, I guess they had and they probably heard I heard.

00;24;38;18 - 00;24;43;15
Speaker 5
No, he went in there and homesteaded it after her husband died.

00;24;43;28 - 00;24;45;06
Speaker 1
she was.

00;24;45;08 - 00;25;23;15
Speaker 5
Well, you know, there a boy with a man who won't do a portion of caring for. And after his sister's husband died, who was burying him, he was down here. Up there. Now, I never knew her. After he died, she was around, so she came in to be with her brother and then homesteaded the adjoining piece of property.

00;25;23;17 - 00;26;05;11
Speaker 5
Sure. You all you told me and my mine and all the way down a little. then, you know, things. Pictures were there in the caravan, and I thought a lot of them. And they belonged to Mrs. Bellingham with her brother. It was awful. But I always gamble when I'm before I ever came in the country. So just so you know, he was the first to be killed.

00;26;05;13 - 00;26;08;07
Speaker 2
Girl, I know.

00;26;08;10 - 00;26;13;05
Speaker 5
But they didn't know for sure he was guard, Right. And brought them with him.

00;26;15;02 - 00;26;20;21
Speaker 1
where they know it was the most likely they'll.

00;26;20;24 - 00;26;47;24
Speaker 5
And then I don't know what I remember her going. You know what he left after he died. After he was buried. He left right And there that this all happened. It was passed by the town. We got into the country and people by the name or maybe moved down to the ranch and then we we we were friendly with them.

00;26;47;24 - 00;26;58;22
Speaker 5
And that's when I was in to have a friend get something. Never left in the cabin. And I will. I will go.

00;26;58;25 - 00;26;59;27
Speaker 3
You mean a.

00;27;00;02 - 00;27;20;24
Speaker 5
No, no, But it's that they don't. At that time, we the male came down the creek only as far as having creek, and we used to have to go out there and now we are.

00;27;20;24 - 00;27;24;09
Speaker 3
They brought it Now were they flying it in the camp bakery.

00;27;24;11 - 00;27;24;18

00;27;28;19 - 00;27;30;03
Speaker 3
Over there right. Yeah.

00;27;30;05 - 00;27;32;01
Speaker 5
It came down on my.

00;27;32;03 - 00;27;37;16
Unknown
Right or and here far is that.

00;27;37;18 - 00;27;39;08
Speaker 5
Seven mile.

00;27;39;11 - 00;27;45;12
Speaker 2
To seven mile from here to get back to my creek up to the. Well I guess he came from Big Creek.

00;27;45;15 - 00;28;02;16
Speaker 5
Yeah. Yeah. I would think. Yeah. It wasn't. Do they fact not cry. But if they had to stay on the ground lowering it, they had a cabinet. Their big idea.

00;28;02;18 - 00;28;15;07
Speaker 3
Now what about the little plant on this side of Big Creek That's right up by Gavin Creek. Pretty close. They got a real short airstrip on it now.

00;28;15;19 - 00;28;23;22
Speaker 5
that would be down here about three miles above. Yeah, it'd be terrifying range.

00;28;23;24 - 00;28;24;28
Speaker 2
More service by that.

00;28;24;28 - 00;28;32;29
Speaker 5
You know, I got I think it was so and by then they were very bitter.

00;28;33;01 - 00;28;35;26
Speaker 1
They got the doing more doing.

00;28;35;28 - 00;28;38;03
Speaker 3
More or less than that. Yeah. I don't know.

00;28;38;06 - 00;28;40;25
Speaker 5
How about now on the other side.

00;28;40;28 - 00;28;46;19
Speaker 1
You know, that's on the trail. They had to do it more. They would always run and.

00;28;46;21 - 00;28;50;03
Speaker 5
And you're, you read a fine terrible line here.

00;28;50;06 - 00;29;10;12
Speaker 1
You get everything figured out and get carried up then he get back out of it. He didn't want got in the picnic line so he tied them up right away and we didn't know what to do and thought, you know, but the rest.

00;29;10;13 - 00;29;46;02
Speaker 5
Is wrong that you won't go to the part of the time he owned Durand Line that he married period, was living on the ranch and taking care of it for in the fall. He gave me him and it was Curtis who carried the mail in the last year that they used horses. And while he was building that he would command and that's the mail right here.

00;29;46;04 - 00;30;16;16
Speaker 5
He's he's a little run and Cherokee and he can only there are only certain horses that he could manage and that she can get up on. Yeah, I hear he went up to victory and he got the mail and, and your mother at this time decided it was cheaper to have you grocery send him by far probably than it was to have them.

00;30;16;20 - 00;30;39;20
Speaker 5
I don't know how they got him. Sit down again. I guess I'm going. There was the whining here then have have burning and he'd go down and get them. So he had the mail in the parcel post and he had a case of mail when he got somewhere down the line by looking over the mail, going all over the hillside.

00;30;39;23 - 00;30;43;07
Speaker 5
And he, you know, already in me up in Oklahoma.

00;30;43;07 - 00;30;50;20
Speaker 2
And to get to see or take that.

00;30;50;23 - 00;31;26;04
Speaker 5
He was very I think, come down occasionally and he was the very independent person. He would come down here. We brought her a girl and he would take her horses down to Corral and confirm they care of them. Why they'd come back. And I can't remember. I think we had cancer that horses do carry the heavy with us here and very independent and in your rear.

00;31;26;06 - 00;31;56;21
Speaker 5
We had a young one year, Mr. and when he was growing out you would look up at one, right? Right. And he'd go out there visiting to get out. There are two trails, the one from Parent Creek up your point, and you look back to what they come down here and sometimes you can bet that he came down here to the senior.

00;31;56;24 - 00;32;19;17
Speaker 5
Well, I don't remember. He couldn't get it. He couldn't get back on Quinny. He got on board and walked very, very quickly and she ran her door a great, great queen. You wouldn't let her on.

00;32;19;19 - 00;32;30;04
Speaker 3
See Johnson, the photographic shop you mentioned in Boise that it was his father.

00;32;30;06 - 00;32;34;18
Speaker 5
With his brother, you 50 figures. Are you still hoping?

00;32;34;20 - 00;32;36;15
Speaker 3
Do you remember what his name.

00;32;36;15 - 00;32;49;23
Speaker 5
Was and your answer? And and, and yeah, I think they were going to do when they're Norwegian.

00;32;49;25 - 00;32;58;06
Speaker 3
Yeah, I was just thinking he might have the negatives, you know, he might still have them catalog or something for his son.

00;32;58;09 - 00;33;19;01
Speaker 5
I'm sure they're asking Johnson and his wife wonder and living out for the year in Palm Springs. but the boy has the sharp in boy and he photographic work but they're the old negatives the old boy they probably would be old boy.

00;33;19;04 - 00;33;20;07
Speaker 3
All the grass quite.

00;33;20;10 - 00;33;29;17
Speaker 5
Well. It probably would be that long ago. I don't know how long ago that would be.

00;33;29;19 - 00;33;32;04
Speaker 3
But I'm sure they would have been.

00;33;32;04 - 00;33;37;28

Speaker 5
Go in the ballroom. But they don't have to point to their parents because they've been in the family only until.

00;33;55;12 - 00;33;59;15
Speaker 2
Apparently you said that they had quite a few pictures.

00;33;59;18 - 00;34;07;16
Speaker 5
Yeah. I mean, that may have been. Yeah, yeah, I remember that. This one and they brought it back to me here.

00;34;07;20 - 00;34;11;02
Speaker 3
Would any of them predate that picture?

00;34;11;05 - 00;34;16;28
Speaker 5
No, I think that they would have been taken out on the same trip. Seem to.

00;34;17;00 - 00;34;25;14
Speaker 1
You know, one of the old cabinet here, I think. And there were a little park ranger about them.

00;34;25;21 - 00;34;39;25
Speaker 5
I know those were not taken by photography. No, no. That was the camera. It was an open drive.

00;34;39;27 - 00;34;57;02
Speaker 3
Did Walter Easton had did he have a family? No. You know. then the other question was what was done with, with Easter, you know, during the time after he was shot, at the time that the sheriff came.

Unknown

Unknown
Come down where.

00;35;54;24 - 00;36;29;22
Speaker 5
We know where they were in that meeting and we were ready. The year to go, something like that. And so they were inside and he was not a very well-liked man near River right in there. The man he lived at, they removed great and he they said he with me. He had a very nice pair. Yeah. And he always said that he wanted to be buried by going there.

00;36;29;25 - 00;36;45;05
Speaker 5
Yeah. There. So he did. He died in the summer. Right in the middle of summer. Very recently. Diapers, because he had a heart attack from packing in and out, and he died. And they didn't find me for a new.

00;36;45;08 - 00;36;45;25
Speaker 3
Buried right.

00;36;45;25 - 00;36;56;04
Speaker 1
On feet. They left the game. Barton and out in there were never been arrested burned down any good.

00;36;56;07 - 00;37;00;11
Speaker 3
It frustrated.

00;37;00;14 - 00;37;15;13
Speaker 5
You know like I just don't understand why they came here and of course be with them have to fight a temper and you taking that game and then bring him back in there you.

00;37;15;15 - 00;37;18;26
Speaker 1
Know not as a threat or.

00;37;18;28 - 00;37;27;03
Speaker 3
That's why they would pose a problem because even with daughter, which, you know, they wouldn't have a farm for that, they.

00;37;27;05 - 00;37;27;26
Speaker 5
Would.

00;37;27;29 - 00;37;28;07
Speaker 2
You know.

00;37;28;14 - 00;37;29;07
Speaker 1

00;37;29;07 - 00;37;30;26
Speaker 2
Book. You have a family.

00;37;30;27 - 00;37;38;12

That they paid out I understand here and had car driven by. But then you went up work. I mean.

00;37;38;15 - 00;37;43;22
Speaker 5
Everything. I always.

00;37;43;25 - 00;37;57;10
Speaker 1
Thinking that we first come in here, we had to be able to handle it there And the old supervisor and all all and frankly, a lot of the original personnel, you know.

00;37;57;17 - 00;38;00;13
Speaker 3
Now with with that death or the death or command.

00;38;00;13 - 00;38;11;08
Speaker 1
Or whatever that was before that he retired, then that poor died and now you've got the farm or then how are your.

00;38;11;10 - 00;38;13;16
Speaker 3
I mean, there was more than.

00;38;13;20 - 00;38;26;26
Speaker 1
That. We've written right under a dam. A dam. And we went through a lot of rain come and go and but not these days with it in here. Now I think you must endure a tender. I don't.

00;38;26;29 - 00;38;29;28

00;38;36;05 - 00;38;37;11
Speaker 5
You probably did too.

00;38;37;14 - 00;39;03;10
Speaker 1
Well, I'm not weary anyhow, and went through the three mile one higher. We had been doing business, I mean, here about a year ago. Well, then two years ago I had become long. And, you know, William probably Moody, he said, yes, why don't you and I buried I had I know I'm a with me. I got in grade.

00;39;03;12 - 00;39;10;04
Speaker 1
I really don't go over in on that. We think they're stepping on.

00;39;10;06 - 00;39;16;04
Speaker 3
What what sort of a fella was never he was alright.

00;39;16;07 - 00;39;20;21
Speaker 1
But he was a sick man. But I don't think anybody realized what.

00;39;20;21 - 00;39;24;08
Speaker 3
Was cancer of the brain. Yeah, yeah.

00;39;24;11 - 00;39;26;05
Speaker 5
Yeah. No, I.

00;39;26;07 - 00;39;47;23
Speaker 1
You come down here to straighten out a deal. We'd had a problem here with a fella name ago. He's running all over the country and gambling on that would embark upon anywhere he played. And then he'd come along your camp and get move in and we finally got tired of it. And. And so Don brought that bear, and we talked the matter all over.

00;39;47;25 - 00;39;54;23
Speaker 1
We had figured Gabby had it down on your barn. When you leave it right there, get the dirty and grown up with cans and that the area.

00;39;54;26 - 00;39;56;06
Speaker 2
Terrible.

00;39;56;08 - 00;40;22;08
Speaker 1
And he moved into my right point camp up there after we pulled up and burned on our wood and that and read it out himself. By the time it took out the Malcolm and and Matthew Dirty Man and he pulled into a shipyard mine where you're on it burned pretty good way off that way and told the barn what high in there broke and all over and and I told us about it and I said listen if you want that camp cleaned up, you've gone up there and cleaned up.

00;40;22;08 - 00;40;22;18
Speaker 1
I'm not.

00;40;22;18 - 00;40;24;03
Speaker 3
Going to take you out.

00;40;24;04 - 00;40;46;04
Speaker 1
Of the thing. Get get a little cleaning for me. And he didn't buy anything. He didn't have anybody coming. But we've always been very careful to maintain a nice camp, have a bit buried, dig them out once in a while. Well, that's nothing you can that's all part of it. But you ground them up, bro. Make no.

00;40;46;06 - 00;40;47;25
Speaker 5
Mistake, Arthur was a very nice.

00;40;47;25 - 00;41;12;02
Speaker 1
Person. Yeah, he was. And we liked him. We never. We never did this, we thought. But, you know, I'm sure of that. But he didn't act right when he was here that last time, you know, just to you can make a straight statement or something. But we didn't realize what the problem was and he gone very long at that time.

00;41;12;05 - 00;41;48;19
Speaker 3
I know. I know his boy. And he's he's younger and I guess he's 31 now. But he said and some other people I've talked to, the reason I ask the question, but only Bill I've talked to spoke very highly of his father. Yeah yeah. But his out Why mention that that when Mr. Drexler you know very last why he just you know for a man that was so quick of mind you know and I guess in pretty good physical shape to you know but I know I know he was, you know, really had a sharp mind.

00;41;48;19 - 00;41;59;21
Speaker 3
And then the scene where he just, you know, everything good went in there. Last one, he didn't recognize anybody in the family. Well, it was very painful on.

00;41;59;23 - 00;42;04;19
Speaker 1
Her enduring right when he was here. But we didn't realize, you know what, the commitment probably you didn't need it.

00;42;04;19 - 00;42;05;27
Speaker 3
No, I don't think.

00;42;06;00 - 00;42;13;07
Speaker 1
You done the down the day get too late that no.

00;42;13;09 - 00;42;19;07
Unknown
What was that question you were asking about was part of or. yeah.

00;42;19;10 - 00;42;25;14
Speaker 2
Yeah. But we talked my family, you know.

00;42;25;17 - 00;42;34;22
Speaker 3
You mentioned that you had the minutes for the original agreement. A very classification meeting or something. I wonder.

00;42;34;22 - 00;42;46;04
Speaker 1
I mean, it's grown up, but it's the delegation that came in here. They territorial all over and they're recommended and it was quite over.

00;42;46;06 - 00;42;53;19
Speaker 3
I wonder if it might be possible for us to bar that and Xerox it, you know, and we weren't worried.

00;42;53;21 - 00;42;54;12
Speaker 1
If we ever.

00;42;54;15 - 00;42;55;08
Speaker 5
Come to.

00;42;55;11 - 00;42;58;05
Speaker 3
Yeah, that's what I know. But and the other side, there are some of.

00;42;58;05 - 00;43;01;18
Speaker 1
This we've got a downturn in Europe. Have you Haven't had it.

00;43;01;18 - 00;43;40;08
Speaker 3
Yeah but there's some of this material that I think will help us in preparing, you know, proposal and direction for the tell you the ranch because I really I think anything that we borrow or we utilize should go back to until such time that you're that there's a written agreement. Yeah see that that you all are sure you know it'll be a binding agreement that what happened you know from then on because I if I were in your position, I wouldn't turn anything over unless I was, I knew and it was a by now.

00;43;40;10 - 00;43;40;15
Speaker 1
We've.

00;43;40;17 - 00;43;41;01
Speaker 5
Got.

00;43;41;04 - 00;43;42;01
Speaker 1
You know.

00;43;42;03 - 00;43;42;12
Speaker 3
Yeah.

00;43;42;17 - 00;43;47;08
Speaker 1
Some agreement. Yeah. Yeah. It had taken care of.

00;43;47;10 - 00;44;25;09
Speaker 5
And we had a very, an old early day mining engineer, he was 80 or 87 years old coming in from San Diego. You I think he stepped in. Right. And yeah. You were in there before this year and after the character early day going around San Francisco and I suppose from even from the early Spanish ground and there weren't, you know, and I got the papers out and he looked at to me, the things are right.

00;44;25;11 - 00;44;26;12
Speaker 5
Take care.

00;44;26;14 - 00;44;46;29
Speaker 3
Yeah, I know. With Wolfram Buyers and some of the other people over on the way, you know, I looked Xerox all of the for service material but there's a lot of their personal material, you know, and a lot of these people, it's taken quite a while to gain your confidence, you know, so that they realize that you weren't really going to use them, you know, or something.

00;44;47;00 - 00;44;57;24
Speaker 3
And and but but I, I value very much, you know, what their concern. And that's why I think I at least I can understand.

00;44;57;27 - 00;45;26;01
Speaker 1
Well we we the fortunate that we had scattered in between here and might be the doctor love him he was very much impressed with not only the when he brought up the idea of making me Ricardo and but I'm sure that that we're kind of getting on this situation I make quite better regarding, you know, buy it time to make, you know, think things over a bit.

00;45;26;04 - 00;45;49;15
Speaker 5
And they're here over the year. Usually in one time I ran into a few more men and the one that we have, that is where the map of the of the game of the year Xi beat her campaign.

00;45;49;18 - 00;46;16;23
Speaker 1
They made three correct in terribly wrong qualifying and got Barnegat and then they had Minion go with them and they they found the camp. we got on that but great network got it name and they never then they all out running in the golden parachute there so they this is Lieutenant Barrow then finally rounded them up and they that the only in in or no bank down bunker.

00;46;16;25 - 00;46;43;08
Speaker 1
Well what point or that like that they didn't know anything what score. Well dog one of them when they had they shoot out of here got smoked up they couldn't see the Indian they didn't see them and Indian pulled out one smoke with one lieutenant and his arms around the tree and they the funny part was he was on the side of the three next Indian and the if the matter record even if you got Martin McCarty that matter of record.

00;46;43;10 - 00;46;45;24
Speaker 2
Yeah.

00;46;45;26 - 00;46;51;22
Speaker 1
As the type of Indian like you. Yeah. You don't.

00;46;51;24 - 00;46;53;14
Speaker 2
See it.

00;46;53;17 - 00;47;19;21
Speaker 5
You you I think you didn't do it. You mean that there would be. Yeah. And Bernard from both and you know with 125 man and came into this type of country with men on foot and a factory looking for anything, you know, I think even I did more than that.

00;47;19;23 - 00;47;39;08
Speaker 1
Well, if you went off and told your barn back. But you know, you you don't know where going to be. Not no. He had a pretty rough go another outfit when they were bought you Mandela out this other way and they had they had to carry everything to the stadium.

00;47;39;11 - 00;47;42;23
Speaker 2
And I always feel threatened by it in the same way.

00;47;42;26 - 00;47;43;12
Speaker 1
You know you know.

00;47;43;17 - 00;47;45;10
Speaker 5
I think over there and.

00;47;45;12 - 00;47;56;15
Speaker 3
Vietnamese, you're getting you're fighting with people to live off the land. You know, the bad like what they were doing and we were there that they had this tremendous life support system with it. You know.

00;47;56;18 - 00;48;00;29
Speaker 5
And these Indians were all at home here. You know.

00;48;01;02 - 00;48;22;07
Speaker 1
Certainly they were not on anybody. They they burned they laid it on the Indians over here, what they call the Johnson Ranch over here on Yellow Pine. They moved them right there and killed a couple of Johnsons or somebody over there and and burned the head. That and that's what gives the army account. They go made to David, but regretful anyhow.

00;48;22;07 - 00;48;34;18
Speaker 1
You know, they had nothing to justify their existence, sort of like the Corps. Yeah. Yeah. But then that is, you know, the Indians never done that.

00;48;34;19 - 00;48;35;21
Speaker 5
You know.

00;48;35;23 - 00;48;42;06
Speaker 1
They and then they, they worked in the mines, they done whatever they could get to do and they never bothered anybody that had run against them, you know.

00;48;42;06 - 00;48;44;14
Speaker 5
Yeah. Well that renegade Harry the.

00;48;44;15 - 00;49;00;12
Speaker 1
Done it and then the Indian got in my book and that boy that you know when they were back so I had tried but you know they had only one letter and that would be my thing and wrote down around some girl.

00;49;00;15 - 00;49;22;12
Speaker 5
No. Yeah. In the early days and my family by the name out and lived on and doing war ranch and they had they had several children and then as they grew I of course they went.

00;49;22;12 - 00;49;29;09
Unknown
Outside and you know, one of the girl is a little quick that right.

00;49;29;12 - 00;49;42;04
Speaker 5
Yeah. It round in paper they were out their side grade right. That line along. You remember her name. Well things like that. It was a character.

00;49;42;11 - 00;49;48;08
Unknown
Band gathering around and we stayed in.

00;49;48;08 - 00;49;52;27
Speaker 2
For service as a party with no.

00;49;52;29 - 00;49;59;17
Speaker 5
The other. That's how they got to live. That was during the Hue fever and, you know.

00;49;59;20 - 00;50;04;11
Speaker 3
The soldiers coming in the country. And we knew we.

00;50;04;13 - 00;50;05;28
Speaker 5
Were in Virginia Garrison and.

00;50;05;28 - 00;50;15;23
Unknown
All that care when they were over.

00;50;15;23 - 00;50;18;00
Speaker 5
There. And she found it. And there.

00;50;18;03 - 00;50;22;13
Speaker 3
Was that one of the early days and for service book Yeah about the eight.

00;50;22;20 - 00;50;39;03
Speaker 5
No, no it's just too bad that one was just. okay. But it would be interesting to you because of their history in the country that this girl writes about throughout the girl.

00;50;39;06 - 00;50;40;12
Speaker 3
You have a popular.

00;50;40;15 - 00;50;44;14
Speaker 5
I think that you're in Boise that you know you learn your books.

00;50;44;15 - 00;50;52;01
Speaker 3
And there Yeah yeah. That's why I said if we took anything, we Xerox it and return the original. But there.

00;50;52;07 - 00;50;53;25
Speaker 5
Other I know there are people that.

00;50;53;26 - 00;50;55;29
Speaker 1
Live here, but it would be of interest.

00;50;56;01 - 00;51;07;03
Speaker 5
He had that it was printed by I think actually produced in Boise or in Caldwell and I think you can write about going there now.

00;51;07;04 - 00;51;11;25
Speaker 3
You know we can check the.

00;51;11;28 - 00;51;17;19
Speaker 5
We have the carry book. But I know what I think is very boring. But you can go gardening.

00;51;17;27 - 00;51;40;19
Speaker 2
You know I was almost five and one of the things that we probably want to do is to love and care about and, you know, a few things, we can probably help you identify gaps and maybe there are things there that you can help us. We get you specific questions and maybe that you may recall something about, something that we know that's not very clear.

00;51;40;22 - 00;51;46;16
Speaker 2
I mean, this is a it's a kind of a catalytic thing for us. It gets us thinking.

00;51;46;19 - 00;51;50;25
Unknown
If we don't do something, we go and we can start asking.

00;51;50;25 - 00;52;16;16
Speaker 3
Questions. You know that. And it may help us develop the proposal to bring in archeology, anthropology, you know, to do some historical research right here, because that something like that is a perfect master's program. So for somebody either in history or in historical archeology and it just fits and it would be an opportunity to work partially out of here and use it.

00;52;16;17 - 00;52;42;27
Speaker 3
Use this as as a base for historical research. You mentioned Henry Howard in the part of Harry. Harry. I've got Harry here. I can read it from the floor. Harry Showers and the party break or played in the primitive very classification. Is this documented or you knew this or what?

00;52;42;29 - 00;52;47;18
Speaker 1
Well, no, they're all in that picture. We've gotten to.

00;52;47;20 - 00;52;49;22
Speaker 5
Know is you saw in mirror.

00;52;49;24 - 00;52;51;22
Speaker 1
And a lot of them the minute you.

00;52;51;22 - 00;52;52;29
Speaker 3
Think about the letter that would.

00;52;53;03 - 00;52;54;25
Speaker 5
Clarify everything in.

00;52;54;25 - 00;53;05;26
Speaker 1
There. Yeah and their recommendation and the boundary recommendations and I believe were there the the whole thing is they, they think that.

00;53;05;26 - 00;53;15;07

You probably heard about the experiment. They have a whole group of them get together, go down to Mexico for a weekend or so, you know, and well, a caller, one fan and he got a little behind them. But anywhere you go on. But they're starting to get dark. So he just sat down. But if Mexican happens here, I get through the room, they're all around me instead of down on my side or maybe a small group there and anyhow, I had to stay the night and they come in here and in bed, you know, they even dug up Lindsay Park and they denied me that, you know, the next we had milk at drink and

Speaker 3
Have you seen one like that anyplace? You know, not in any of the museums. You know.

It's all gone now. Pretty high water down there And the down here. Right hand the little little island right in the great big drift out there.

00;58;22;15 - 00;58;42;01
Speaker 1
And I could wait out, do it, and I'd make hold all through the drip, you know, and I'd go over there, over that bear. You didn't know you could catch them and didn't have any how you get one of them. And so I crawled out there with his bear and where I'd had these old, you know, I did work like wild one the other and it do not the legal examined either one of them.

00;58;42;01 - 00;59;58;09
Speaker 1
