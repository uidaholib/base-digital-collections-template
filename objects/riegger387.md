Hal Riegger:
Oh, yeah.


00:00:32:12 - 00:00:48:14

Main Street and mine are the main street of natural parallel. We've learned to live in Max's 11 miles from Douglas. Mine in Denver. Excuse. Is south west from Max? Mostly with.

I can't tell you exactly how often Max is from minor, but it's about probably 36 miles. The. Douglas is 11 miles from max with you. So you're a part of town live? Yeah, but my dad no really helped bridge the streets. And I got nowhere to go to in 19 two with officers. These locks. And in that paper, if you look through the.

Earl Cash:
Oh, yeah. You can see. Is for sure. I'll let you see that, too.


00:01:31:03 - 00:01:59:25
Hal Riegger:
I remember I spent about two years out there in 1943, 45. near Williston, little place called Trenton. and I remember I was so impressed that I was born and brought up in the East and so impressed that you could see a storm way off the the mild waves coming. No, no, we couldn't do that back home.


00:02:00:21 - 00:02:10:00
Hal Riegger:
I thought it was pretty barren at first, but after a couple of years, I got to like it real well. So.


00:02:11:20 - 00:02:18:05
Earl Cash:
nice to meet you. I don't think it's interesting that they. They struck oil. That there?


00:02:18:07 - 00:02:19:11
Hal Riegger:
Yeah.


00:02:20:28 - 00:02:22:26
Earl Cash:
they lived through it.


00:02:22:29 - 00:02:26:17
Hal Riegger:
Oh, I'm not sure. Yeah, I think maybe it is Lewis.


00:02:26:19 - 00:02:30:08
Earl Cash:
Maybe it was Lewis. You could think.


00:02:30:10 - 00:02:34:12
Hal Riegger:
Yeah, it's that northwest corner of,


00:02:34:15 - 00:02:40:13
Earl Cash:
No. well, not necessarily. Williston is.


00:02:40:15 - 00:02:42:24
Hal Riegger:
Well, Williston is Willis.


00:02:42:27 - 00:03:08:02
Earl Cash:
Yeah. Lewis and Lewis Town is in the northwest called Lewis down on the Montana. That's right on the border of, it's about 900 is about mine. That's about 200 miles. About 200 miles from the west border. It's about 100 120 miles from the Canadian border.


00:03:08:04 - 00:03:09:12
Hal Riegger:
Muhammad.


00:03:09:14 - 00:03:26:04
Earl Cash:
I never been up. Really? Border? they're one of the few, but I can't remember. Yeah, we have a variance a mile away from the Canada. And then we come down the next best North Dakota. That's north west three miles when I. There's not no kids.


00:03:26:07 - 00:03:26:24
Hal Riegger:
Yeah.


00:03:26:27 - 00:03:41:17
Earl Cash:
And and I can't remember too much about that then, but I've driven back there was a very good brother back there. through his 16 years ago. We moved back.


00:03:41:19 - 00:03:42:06
Hal Riegger:
Home.


00:03:42:09 - 00:03:45:19
Earl Cash:
And never been back there because I grew up back there.


00:03:45:21 - 00:03:46:21
Hal Riegger:
Yeah, but.


00:03:46:24 - 00:03:55:13
Earl Cash:
We're lost, you know? So to me, like, for then really lose to North Dakota is the largest lignite coal mine in the world.


00:03:55:15 - 00:03:57:21
Hal Riegger:
Yeah. I had like the out. That's right.


00:03:57:22 - 00:04:18:01
Earl Cash:
And now they start going over there. They had it on the news the other night and they got there and and they did have one hell of a time, which I know there's only one with that country. I got a niece living in Washburn, North Dakota that's 41 miles from Bismarck, right up the Missouri River.


00:04:18:06 - 00:04:19:07
Hal Riegger:
Yeah.


00:04:20:03 - 00:04:46:15
Earl Cash:
and Washburn is 21 miles from the Garrison Dam. I was there when the Garrison Dam started, and I was. There were three. And I just happened to be back there. I never wanted to go back there until our son, he got married when he got married, but he was back, and my niece was in Bismarck, North Dakota, having to bring.


00:04:46:18 - 00:04:47:13
Hal Riegger:
Him.


00:04:47:15 - 00:05:12:21
Earl Cash:
Back there. And and he was ready to come home and, and, and I really was a prisoner of war for the time and, and, they were, you know, who was working here. And I had some the cousins living in Bismarck and actually there was a guy with my urine. So just like you just kind of went through the third period.


00:05:12:22 - 00:05:13:26
Hal Riegger:
Yeah.


00:05:13:28 - 00:05:34:25
Earl Cash:
And I said the evolution of, like, that guy down, and I rode the Bismarck with him, and I saw some because my brother just slipped through the son of a bitch and her running down. And we're getting ready to fight you. Oh, you did fine. And he'd like to have a gun to me. So we rode the Bismarck with him.


00:05:34:25 - 00:05:51:19
Earl Cash:
We had a hell of a nice time and he was going. We go on the other side of Bismarck to, go to land there and move down there. Way, way. Got 18 miles on there. He said, we won't. We going with you like my country. Like there, there someone in the room. Was you.


00:05:51:21 - 00:05:52:18
Hal Riegger:
Sure? Yeah.


00:05:52:19 - 00:06:12:22
Earl Cash:
Well, I told him what time was a damn short, and I had 3 or 4 cousins and a couple of big guys to go with him, and, well, he had never done worst in Bismarck tonight. You said that. Come and go with me and then know, take you back home to work. You got me anyway. So but it was really funny.


00:06:12:22 - 00:06:39:04
Earl Cash:
Anyway, is. But my my niece was married before, and then she separated. This marriage. This guy. This guy. Oh, you want to have North Dakota and you got. And you got wounded in the army. What are you about? Four. And, the name was bore you. You got one wrong on him. So you can live with one run and guess.


00:06:39:04 - 00:07:06:04
Earl Cash:
And and his dad was a representative in North Dakota. He was from the next in the Russian, the people of Russian descent. And he talked to the president and table and and very nice people, very strange people, very Justin Bieber. But we did we got business plan. We got very, very, very good money.


00:07:06:06 - 00:07:23:27
Hal Riegger:
So they didn't they, convert or change. They the fire boxes, on the, on the Great Northern Engines to use lignite burned lignite instead of coal than they do then, you know.


00:07:24:04 - 00:07:25:15
Earl Cash:
Well, years ago, did.


00:07:25:15 - 00:07:27:25
Hal Riegger:
You you know, it's from a long, long time ago. Yeah.


00:07:27:25 - 00:07:29:00
Earl Cash:
Wrong guy. Oh, yeah.


00:07:29:08 - 00:07:32:14
Hal Riegger:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:07:35:00 - 00:07:37:13
Earl Cash:
You know, they run lignite coal.


00:07:37:16 - 00:07:44:24
Hal Riegger:
Well, we burn that up there in the campfires then. I know, and it wasn't smoky as the beginning. Coal fell apart the minute.


00:07:44:25 - 00:07:50:15
Earl Cash:
And what a snack it was like, you know, you know, well, I did mine.


00:07:50:18 - 00:07:57:16
Hal Riegger:
But we used to pay, maybe that would seem expensive. You're going to get it for about a dollar and a half a pound.


00:07:57:18 - 00:08:05:06
Earl Cash:
Oh, I sold many, many tons of $0.50 to little mine. And I made and done.


00:08:05:12 - 00:08:06:11
Hal Riegger:
And.


00:08:06:14 - 00:08:15:13
Earl Cash:
Good work to where I lived in North Dakota and worked there. And was there a real room, that cold front part of the bank. You got to dig it yourself, you know.


00:08:15:13 - 00:08:16:15
Hal Riegger:
During during.


00:08:16:17 - 00:08:38:07
Earl Cash:
The when I was a snot nosed kid, I was adopted out and they had what they call a meter mine. It was their north Dakota, about six miles from where we lived. You take field horses and you strip all six, seven feet of dirt, you know, and then you have two feet of snow cold in the Big North.


00:08:38:07 - 00:08:59:21
Earl Cash:
And we still say get. And then you stripped off, and then you have your six foot vehicle when you have a foot and a half, one meter cord comes in three sections. And it was my job. We go down there and run the pump to pump the water out of this pit, you know, and, keep track of the guys in the farmers all around.


00:08:59:21 - 00:09:17:04
Earl Cash:
In the summertime, we come down and they work out their coal bill. You give them a dollar and a half a day for man and team, and you look up to the scrapers and crown with it from dirt to scrape and, and you give them a dollar and a half a day and they work out their coal. Really in the fall of the year after the harvest.


00:09:17:04 - 00:09:18:23
Earl Cash:
Young they can get their coal.


00:09:18:25 - 00:09:42:16
Hal Riegger:
Yeah. I would say is the right word. Scoria. That's the clay. on top of the, lignite and the lignite, we might catch fire somehow by lightning or something. And and fire that clay up above it. And they use that for the roads, sort of a brick colored stuff. Do you know anything about that? That's right. Is that the right word?


00:09:42:17 - 00:09:51:23
Hal Riegger:
Screw. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. First time I ever saw that. Yeah, yeah. But that's, that's where some of that in North Dakota. Yeah. Yeah.


00:09:51:25 - 00:10:06:24
Earl Cash:
Right. Right. Which you used to do runs all the way from a need to foot thing going on that stuff. Yeah. But the same thing as you came through is built the wood.


00:10:06:26 - 00:10:07:16
Hal Riegger:
Isn't.


00:10:07:19 - 00:10:18:03
Earl Cash:
What you call a fire clay. We all know the difference from North Dakota. Here. Here. It's a it's a mouse colored back there is white practically white. Yellowish white.


00:10:18:05 - 00:10:19:27
Hal Riegger:
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.


00:10:19:27 - 00:10:21:04
Earl Cash:
I read lots of it.


00:10:21:06 - 00:10:27:13
Hal Riegger:
Yeah I went over through Troy. Well this morning I went over to Bovill and I know.


00:10:27:13 - 00:10:28:09
Earl Cash:
You mean traveled.


00:10:28:09 - 00:10:40:26
Hal Riegger:
Around. Well, I want to know how to deal with it. Well, I see I'm up in Moscow. Oh. You are? Yeah. I'm staying at a motel up there, so I don't know about Bovill and no further. And Kinross, too.


00:10:40:26 - 00:10:55:10
Earl Cash:
Anyone could be here. But I looked at just. You never know when you're going to do a damn business. But if you go in the 30, you ask some of them quick to the the new one company.


00:10:55:13 - 00:11:08:06
Hal Riegger:
Well, about all I saw this morning it made me mad were truck after truck pulling speed, speedboats and campers pulling. Oh yeah. So were those back roads? Yeah, they came up the docks everywhere.


00:11:08:09 - 00:11:10:11
Earl Cash:
And what the hell's the matter?


00:11:10:11 - 00:11:21:03
Hal Riegger:
They'll do. What are they doing? You know what the how are they doing? And I wouldn't mind going out on that lake, but I have, like, a canoe in a rowboat. But not of.


00:11:21:03 - 00:11:25:00
Earl Cash:

Hal Riegger:
You told me so many things yesterday.


00:18:16:21 - 00:18:18:13
Earl Cash:
We told the truth, do I?


00:18:18:15 - 00:18:18:29
Hal Riegger:
Right?


00:18:19:01 - 00:18:20:22
Earl Cash:
It was all the truth to him.


00:18:20:22 - 00:18:31:05
Hal Riegger:
Well, I believe that. Yeah. What do you think of the, You know, anything about how the railroad's running now? What do you think of it?


00:18:31:07 - 00:18:35:19
Earl Cash:
Woo hoo hoo!


00:18:35:21 - 00:19:02:05
Earl Cash:
You know, since you asked that question, I want to tell you something. I'm a diabetic. I'm always going to come and, headed, help a good doctor here. He was, you know, for the money, of course. And he was a good doctor near lots of patients. And he was weak in good sized manners. This meal, he wrote.


00:19:02:07 - 00:19:09:19
Earl Cash:
You know that I like you fine. God damn, that's kind of. I like a guy to be firm. And if he's got a mouth full of ships, a shit.


00:19:09:26 - 00:19:10:14
Hal Riegger:
Yeah.


00:19:10:16 - 00:19:31:15
Earl Cash:
Yeah. And, And he told me, I said some good about it, too. Good. God damn it. He said it. If you want to. Nice talk. Go to church. You said it would be. You want to get well. Would get well. One thing that other. He good. But I like him. He liked me very well. Yeah, yeah it was, it was wonderful.


00:19:31:17 - 00:20:02:20
Earl Cash:
But he of got in some trouble. I don't know I think you, I don't know what it was. I really don't know. But, is it a very beautiful wife? Is his father? No. Was very deceived, father. No. Was a minister. And he was very. See you. And then she was. You, very active and everything. He she was a nurse, and she was about everything.


00:20:02:22 - 00:20:26:02
Earl Cash:
And he was pretty knowledgeable. And he wrote in 3 or 4 letters in the to view a lot, to quote me over here, for people tell you what, they were pretty, you know, pretty pretty stink. But I guess you want an excuse to leave or something. He got in some trouble. I don't know just what he does. but he really did live right next door to us here.


00:20:26:02 - 00:20:43:26
Earl Cash:
When he first come. He didn't have a political Christian. And when to do it? I'll be like the millionaire 30 days over. But I got no quarrel with that. But anyhow, I went to another doctor, and he lives here in Clarksville, and he's very concerned about his patients. I've been going to him for about a year and a half.


00:20:43:26 - 00:21:01:23
Earl Cash:
Two years? I don't know, something like that. So about a month ago, he said that I haven't run a check on you physically check on you. You been here? You better run. The gentleman's located. What if you only do what you do? You could either do that or give me a shot in the arm and send me out for sandwiches.


00:21:01:25 - 00:21:23:10
Earl Cash:
That's where I'd like to go anyhow. And get rid of all these dates. Bring. Get on your hair. I said. I would love to dine with you. I knew that you. Okay, we're going to check on. We took about two weeks. You got a doctor working for you? Nice guy. Well, they both have money. He got a Russian name.


00:21:23:12 - 00:21:44:25
Earl Cash:
Oh, yeah. Nice. Got him. Who are you? This check going on? The last time I went over there was a doctor took me in his office. And you heard he didn't have about two hours of weird bullshit that I would deliver. Believe we have a good time. They come in with the cloth tape and he put it around me, and he said, do you smoke?


00:21:44:25 - 00:22:04:12
Earl Cash:
And I said, no, I'll get the two of you this year to. He was in. You've got to you what is right now. I've done this before. I ask you what you said some and ready. How would he got your command? And he just missed me. And he said, I don't know. What the hell do you think you're old enough to be my granddaddy?


00:22:04:12 - 00:22:35:00
Earl Cash:
You're better shake than I am. And bullshit. So couple weeks later, going over for blood sugar and I told him, I got to. If you don't feel good, remember my heart. Christmas 1,000,000,079. And when I get in the cramped position, get to bed night and, you know, get a whole report to come live here with you, run with you and I and I and a little checking if you want to check on you.


00:22:35:03 - 00:22:55:12
Earl Cash:
I told you this year to give you a big if you live. If you don't 80% sweet. Give me some pills and some more fuel. Then you call up the heart specialist and the lady come through the. So that's the way it is. It was a damn route I just wrote in here. I just don't know what the hell this would be like.


00:22:55:14 - 00:22:57:10
Hal Riegger:
To go through.


00:22:57:13 - 00:23:10:08
Earl Cash:
The railroad just will go to hell. The whole country is going to hell anyway. And then finally down there, you should see some of the bottom 6000 years ago just exactly like the bottom. You didn't bother me any at all.


00:23:11:10 - 00:23:14:17
Hal Riegger:
Well you're good you, you do like working for the railroad.


00:23:14:17 - 00:23:37:26
Earl Cash:
Oh yeah. I told you yesterday, I told you if I was working for you and you was barely $0.25 an hour, I think the owners make you $0.10, make you $0.10 an hour. You know, you got to out. Oh, yes. I enjoyed what I told you did. You did. I worked for 47 years. I never missed a pay day, so I must like it pretty well.


00:23:37:29 - 00:23:46:19
Earl Cash:
You, and I was. They always knew where it was at in the. You could get me. And I was always there for you were.


00:23:46:19 - 00:23:52:28
Hal Riegger:
You were. And you're inspected. The bridge was. Is that right? You inspected the bridges?


00:23:53:01 - 00:24:21:09
Earl Cash:
No. I work with the builders for these pictures. Right. If you want to, you go through you because, I went to work the 9th of June, 19, 20, and I was made the assistant foreman the 1st of July, 1941. And I was for the 1st of September, 1925. And I would run up the ladder, and I got to do it sitting on the fist with the thumb of my eyes.


00:24:21:11 - 00:24:29:13
Hal Riegger:
Yeah. Oh, well, what I mean was, were you involved with construction or maintenance or everything?


00:24:29:15 - 00:24:35:21
Earl Cash:
I hope you didn't make any difference what it was. Yeah. You may do with portable.


00:24:35:24 - 00:24:38:12
Hal Riegger:
You know, some of them. You built them, boozer.


00:24:38:15 - 00:24:56:10
Earl Cash:
Oh, yeah. You know, no problem at all. We had. We have a fire. Damn bridge down. We put him in there, you know. Well, I can show you some of them pictures. Do you built that line for morphine up to headquarters. You, 19, 25, 26?


00:24:56:12 - 00:24:57:01
Hal Riegger:
Yeah.


00:24:57:17 - 00:25:19:26
Earl Cash:
when we started operating the 27, that's when they wrote me all the the the thing that when they started to move down here, we, I looked through those pictures that you looking through in there and here. We didn't move. Something happened, I got it, I had a picture there. The first wall between the company road 100 car movie road.


00:25:19:28 - 00:25:26:08
Earl Cash:
Or was it? Didn't you know they got every son of a bitch was doing a radiator, the cream of the crop to start out with.


00:25:26:10 - 00:25:27:01
Hal Riegger:
Yeah, sure.


00:25:27:07 - 00:25:50:11
Earl Cash:
And then in 1933, Christmastime, they had a lot of three feet of snow. Then we going to shoot. We raised and we took that whole cookie out down. It just wiped it up. And they changed the crib when they rebuilt it. When they built the change, you quickly changed your cooking equipment down and you straightened the son of a bitch right out.


00:25:50:11 - 00:26:10:15
Earl Cash:
See a lot of pictures in there shooting that. Did you out in there? rebuild it. And we had to rebuild him. I don't know what we built. several bridges, and I was the youngest foreman. I had to work nights, and they had the crack foreman working days, and they had an engineer who was given. And he used to give him curls.


00:26:10:17 - 00:26:26:04
Earl Cash:
And this engineer was a drunken guy in is all good drinking and fucking raising hammer. And this engineer and I didn't get along with the dam. I never got along with any of them. So we said, when you want to cut off Ruiz, you son of bitch, I don't wanna ever see. God damn it! I don't want you around me.


00:26:26:04 - 00:26:54:04
Earl Cash:
I don't I don't need your fucking girls. I don't want nothing about it. No, and I do twice as much in nighttime as I would like in the A would in the daytime. And. And that caused friction. Yeah. And, come Easter Sunday and then we got into hell and round and I kind of heard through the back door that was going to take Easter Sunday afternoon off, and we had a movie war show on the bridge.


00:26:54:04 - 00:27:16:05
Earl Cash:
And I wound up I took care of it. They had 300 men down on another bridge. The voice fell on the goddamn quick like the golden handles and their waist boots and one thing another. Me. You always had a cigar. And you, though he hardly ever smoked with regard to his gun down. So we got our job done and he was noontime.


00:27:16:05 - 00:27:40:23
Earl Cash:
And while I was there, ready to go when we got ready to drive, finally we ended. I went up to him. I said, what's the story here? That going to take you through it? Oh my God, if we didn't do any more knees, son, did you give them wiggle room? Girl, you and I could have crawled in the hydrogen.


00:27:40:26 - 00:28:05:16
Earl Cash:
Well, I said, are you ready to start dirty? Well, you know what I said. If we going to dinner tonight, we had to go two miles down the track to the Morricone and border guard. I said to help things out a little bit. I said I to take my crew and take the machine and I'll drive. Pilot. One of the other crew, goofy.


00:28:05:18 - 00:28:13:19
Earl Cash:
Oh, he said, I did she do that? I said, I'm not asking you to ask me. I'm asking you if it's all right for me. Go ahead and do it.


00:28:13:21 - 00:28:15:16
Hal Riegger:
Yeah.


00:28:15:19 - 00:28:33:07
Earl Cash:
We had the but 65ft pilot to go. So I drove six five and it was gone for two hours. I time I drove six. Pilot wonder would go on and come back in the later quarters and I would give my not to my crew roof.


00:28:33:09 - 00:28:35:02
Hal Riegger:
Yeah. Got a roof. Yeah.


00:28:35:05 - 00:28:45:01
Earl Cash:
And I come back up to about two hours later and they would put the first time in the goddamn lead. So I said to him, I said, I go back on.


00:28:45:01 - 00:28:45:25
Hal Riegger:
The.


00:28:45:28 - 00:29:01:14
Earl Cash:
Splits shift learned by God. You orders that you take that goddamn wild rover in the morning and you stay loose. So I had to find out in the daytime all the time. Had when you got to be. I got not overtime. See on work.


00:29:01:20 - 00:29:02:01
Hal Riegger:
Sure.


00:29:02:02 - 00:29:12:28
Earl Cash:
Well, hell, I worked well 15, 14 hours a day. The other guy who would have Jesus Christ to work is blue. I was the only son of a bitch. I'll tell you.


00:29:13:01 - 00:29:16:00
Hal Riegger:
When you worked at night, what did you use for light?


00:29:16:02 - 00:29:41:04
Earl Cash:
Well, we had two different lights. We had the lights on the pile driver. And then we had. Good. we had big gas lamps. Yeah. And we had a, I had a I got it myself. I had a Delco light through the generator juice 110. Boom. You know, you just the gas engine.


00:29:41:06 - 00:29:41:24
Hal Riegger:
Yeah. Right.


00:29:41:24 - 00:30:07:14
Earl Cash:
And then I had to throw string of lights about 100ft long and have lights about every 30ft. Why did you give me three in the morning? And I had them in my car because I had lost the night working. And I kept that phone with a real take the boat done. A real good thing. I'd stick it up on some poles and put them lights in there and break this thing up.


00:30:07:14 - 00:30:10:12
Earl Cash:
And here I was, working day night early.


00:30:10:14 - 00:30:12:19
Hal Riegger:
To work on bridges on the Greenville line.


00:30:12:22 - 00:30:13:24
Earl Cash:
Oh, you.


00:30:13:26 - 00:30:14:28
Hal Riegger:

Earl Cash:
I would. Oh, yeah. Oh.


00:30:19:29 - 00:30:26:04
Hal Riegger:
Where did they put that new highway through? Up near a harsher tunnel.


00:30:26:06 - 00:30:30:29
Earl Cash:
Moon one remember very distinctly is good.


00:30:31:01 - 00:30:32:19
Hal Riegger:
When.


00:30:32:21 - 00:30:34:00
Earl Cash:
You're trying to think good years.


00:30:34:00 - 00:30:35:27
Hal Riegger:
What to know.


00:30:35:29 - 00:30:41:00

If you the.


00:30:41:02 - 00:30:42:26
Hal Riegger:
Not too long ago I said, oh.


00:30:42:27 - 00:30:56:03
Earl Cash:

00:31:24:02 - 00:31:28:02
Hal Riegger:
They had to build a new bridge for the railroad in there. Did they?


00:31:28:19 - 00:31:32:28
Earl Cash:
they did. You have to. It.


00:31:33:01 - 00:31:46:07
Hal Riegger:
How about how old are the trestles? Way up above. They're up high. There are a couple of them right near each other, with a cut between them apart until above the horseshoe tunnel. You know where I'm talking, right?


00:31:47:03 - 00:31:48:28
Earl Cash:
where the highway goes underneath.


00:31:49:01 - 00:31:55:29
Hal Riegger:
Yeah. And then up above that, on the railroad, there are two trestles way up high with a cut between.


00:31:56:01 - 00:31:58:06
Earl Cash:
A couple goes in the well.


00:31:58:06 - 00:31:59:19
Hal Riegger:
All right. Well, you can see if you.

00:32:01:28 - 00:32:05:02
Hal Riegger:
What? How long ago were those built?


00:32:05:05 - 00:32:08:16
Earl Cash:
In the 1900.


00:32:08:18 - 00:32:10:19
Hal Riegger:

00:32:10:22 - 00:32:24:00
Earl Cash:

00:32:25:29 - 00:32:34:11
Hal Riegger:
I got an idea. How about if I turn a little piece of paper and stick under the underneath the edge of these? That I'd like to get some kind of.


00:32:34:13 - 00:32:36:00
Earl Cash:
Okay.


00:32:36:02 - 00:32:39:04
Hal Riegger:

Hal Riegger:

00:33:18:25 - 00:33:21:03
Earl Cash:

Road, not the railroad.


00:37:41:06 - 00:37:55:06
Earl Cash:
Not highway. Yeah, 99 years old on a survey. Yeah, but that's the way we would maybe. Or maybe our groceries. You take nowhere. Surprisingly, local news that that's really true. That's true.


00:37:55:09 - 00:38:00:04
Hal Riegger:
Oh, yeah. And understand what it is. Yeah, I was trying to place it.

00:43:56:03 - 00:43:59:11
Hal Riegger:
You know, that was up there the other day.

00:44:23:20 - 00:44:25:29
Hal Riegger:
That number one. The little one. Yeah.


00:44:26:02 - 00:44:34:22
Earl Cash:

00:44:43:14 - 00:45:01:01
Earl Cash:
The steel. I put it in on myself on that bridge. Really good with all the pilot. And then looked it out, poured the concrete and put a steel new.


00:45:01:04 - 00:45:03:02
Hal Riegger:
Oh, that was nice.


00:45:03:28 - 00:45:10:03

00:45:10:15 - 00:45:44:09
Earl Cash:
Nine, 39, 39. This is just you go to this bridge 40. Yeah. No, you go underneath bridge 40, I think near this side of Ferdinand, which is 39. It's on the way about a mile and a half where we looked in timbers down, and you have to put a line on there to pull the timbers out from the bridge, and sometimes you forget to put the line on what it was here on the deck, and then had to walk out the bottom line on the damn thing because the timber was going down.


00:45:44:09 - 00:45:57:03
Earl Cash:
Yeah. If you haven't got this line on here, the damn thing is hanging up. And somebody came with it's a mirror on the ground down here. You can see the timber and they take this little line and they pull a trim row.


00:45:57:11 - 00:45:58:07
Hal Riegger:
Yeah.


00:45:58:09 - 00:46:06:00

00:49:03:24 - 00:49:14:26
Earl Cash:

00:49:14:26 - 00:49:15:27
Hal Riegger:
Yeah.


00:49:16:00 - 00:49:34:17
Earl Cash:
And they worked at the engineer Martin Case. He had knew he would probably do it in steel, too. You know, I never written one before in my life, so I took it down yesterday. I took it down, and, that's that's my boss. To come up with you is important as only for them. Didn't know anything about it.


00:49:34:18 - 00:49:57:01
Earl Cash:
You couldn't get up there before days. I had to go down and the old separator detail separate. He could look when he said how long we take to keep it down the for the day. And then Jesus Christ, I couldn't hear me any better. So here's was started there through his eyes. I took some notes making it to the completion, and I left down easy in.


00:49:57:04 - 00:50:08:04
Earl Cash:
And we didn't need to take him to the city officials. It was something you could play to the bridge.


00:50:08:07 - 00:50:21:02
Earl Cash:
And this is up to the booth. Will Pierce will be there. And I'm not opposed to. We just put new equipment here.


00:50:21:05 - 00:50:21:28
Hal Riegger:
And.


00:50:23:02 - 00:50:49:12
Earl Cash:
you. this thing here that was going to head for the night game, and they picked up a car load of duty. You had three cars. We trained. We had an engine and three car engine and police. One and two. Some hooked up and put this car come loose and tipped over. That took the air and the train stuff.


00:50:49:16 - 00:51:11:27
Earl Cash:
Yeah. And the victim was in the caboose. So the street and the fireman was held in the street and this was on the fireman side. So we came out and everything looked like we can give the engineer signal. We on the rest of the train went to headquarters and see if the car is out in the headquarters. None of this car said would.


00:51:12:01 - 00:51:34:28
Earl Cash:
We went to bed in the very next morning and they come up, the conductor said, here's the car, said, we want to talk to you in track number two. No, you want to go? We want to go. We would we want to go to a backup. But this thing tipped over and cleared the train. They didn't know nothing about going there for about a week.


00:51:35:00 - 00:51:56:17
Earl Cash:
And then my boss right here and said, did he come out of Lawson with. He got to the one thing another. We got to this place and we put this car on the track. Yeah. Certain days. So I took out look up there and one of the road and show me the snow out of this blue track here.


00:51:56:19 - 00:52:20:04
Earl Cash:
And then I took the loose with me. And when they get up, they knew I had the car on track and children were still open. We pushed the car and cleared, and just the time they got there, he knew we have not to have lunch. They're having lunch, I think 37. That's the story on. Yeah. That's unbelievable. That's what happened right there.


00:52:20:28 - 00:52:32:12
