00;02;26;20 - 00;02;55;21
Speaker 3
Well, of course I had gone. Born. I will initially. just to be grateful, to talk. And that's the first time I went back. Well, I guess I was about. I know about the time you came here because I moved out of Idaho in 1940, you know, came back six months ago in here.

00;02;55;23 - 00;03;00;13
Speaker 5
And then all your schooling in Utah High School.

00;03;00;16 - 00;03;13;12
Speaker 3
An undergraduate college course in Utah with my graduate work, really pretty. And then.

00;03;13;14 - 00;03;15;01
Speaker 1
I had to have help in grade that.

00;03;15;01 - 00;03;16;27
Speaker 3
Airport.

00;03;17;00 - 00;03;56;13
Speaker 1
I had a big dream. They both over 1800 became a fortune giving, and I had that actually. And I had a 14 inch three eight border plate note put on that, I've got a terrific capacity. And this garden plow and dynamite, that was my do. And I but this one by and he would take the good with half that and he could handle that big team and I could handle the Flagstaff and we'd just start the up around about all the high places and we'd get started up around and we get make piles across.

00;03;56;13 - 00;04;21;02
Speaker 1
We're feeling that way all the time. That slip and I could do a shave there and Roots would get them big rooms. They weren't too big pride and big with that little dirt. And you've come down over town, you shake the root of that. I'd do it. It gone and migrated everybody to that airport that way to 1600 feet.

00;04;21;04 - 00;04;54;16
Speaker 1
And then I, i it, I had gone for a big of a long birch and so they took me back and probably a half a dozen men not being there that handle it and I right right on the front end of it and that or get found out into a big apron like that and I just drag it up and down, maybe just pick up Burton out there, give the old man, well you get them get moving floor,

00;04;54;18 - 00;04;55;28
Speaker 3
Is the sled still around?

00;04;56;05 - 00;04;58;29
Speaker 1
Yeah, Yeah, right down there. Yeah.

00;04;59;02 - 00;05;01;03
Speaker 3
Yeah. That's all that. When we.

00;05;01;06 - 00;05;02;11
Speaker 4
When all the sand was out in the.

00;05;02;11 - 00;05;24;11
Speaker 1
Garden. Plowed right out here. Yeah, Yeah. I put, I, I'm a blacksmith long and everything out and I put a, a bar at the from down on the shear here up to the beam sharpened bar like there and it ran on to that big roof. Did you shoot them up. That and you've cut them off. Yeah. And I.

00;05;24;17 - 00;05;27;20
Speaker 3
You know for down there.

00;05;27;22 - 00;05;56;17
Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah. Well it was, it was over there and they weren't taking care of it and somebody died too hard to do it and broke it off down there and water didn't bring it all season. So I just gathered up and moved the whole thing over here and then anybody want to do any blacksmithing up there? And I sharpen my pegs and everything, even though and I got me another one.

00;05;56;17 - 00;06;17;12
Speaker 1
And right here in there I've got a small farm boy. We got 100 by 325 feet there and I've got a small farm back of the house and where that back 135 feet in the street and they've got an orchard you've got and go and keep me busy. Yeah.

00;06;17;14 - 00;06;22;02
Speaker 3
That's good to be able to use the water out of the stream and use the water out.

00;06;22;03 - 00;06;31;07
Speaker 1
No, no. We better. Well you know, we're out and everything. We use everything.

00;06;31;09 - 00;06;36;00
Speaker 3
Well, once you got the cabin built and you lived here year round.

00;06;36;02 - 00;07;12;03
Speaker 1
Practically for the first few years, we'd go out about three months and probably four we'd be in here like the year they, we taking fishermen, that 100 to finance that thing. And we never we never bought anything that we couldn't make eligible. And when I quit and when I quit contracting, I had the idea what I wanted in the air and I bought all these door and lumber and everything, and we had it piled out.

00;07;12;04 - 00;07;17;27
Speaker 1
Metal. What does that offer the to see the airport? And you couldn't hardly get in the office.

00;07;17;29 - 00;07;18;10
Speaker 2
Man.

00;07;18;10 - 00;07;32;16
Speaker 1
It's been very open that airport like five or ten altogether for this town and man we built cabin of the same. I had the flooring everything by now.

00;07;32;16 - 00;07;39;00
Speaker 4
Which one did you build first this and you started this cabin and.

00;07;39;02 - 00;07;45;02
Speaker 1
You know, we cut the logs in the winter of 48.

00;07;45;04 - 00;07;48;22
Speaker 4
49 and move them upstream.

00;07;48;25 - 00;07;58;28
Speaker 1
No, nothing came out of the 1009. But that that was in that cabin down there. They all came out of that locomotive timber bottom.

00;07;58;28 - 00;08;00;20
Speaker 4
Or could you shed these down here.

00;08;00;25 - 00;08;01;09
Speaker 1
yeah.

00;08;01;11 - 00;08;05;04
Speaker 5
It was hard to get one of them.

00;08;05;04 - 00;08;20;24
Speaker 1
Yeah, it is. A drag trail really Goes about a half mile up the canyon course. The upper end of it now is pretty well gone and broken up. You wouldn't even know it there, but I went into a beautiful stand where I have been better known.

00;08;20;26 - 00;08;42;00
Speaker 5
I could ride the horse. The trail's too narrow. You can drive it or well, if you're leaving. But you could stay ahead of me. And I grabbed the heart out with the log and I could take them off down here in the flat. And it ours back up and I think was good, right? maybe four trips a day.

00;08;42;03 - 00;09;12;08
Speaker 1
Yeah. We had logs scattered all over that barn. And I had this road around here growing up here three or time, whatever I could handle and roam right up to get there and frame them, bring them right out on Skid Drive onto the I don't believe quarter downhill first. And I had to hold them like but after I got a little higher wagon you go out and get brought in there all frame rate no.

00;09;12;11 - 00;09;14;19
Speaker 4
So you did all your training up there.

00;09;14;22 - 00;09;17;20
Speaker 3
Right here on the road, right back up.

00;09;17;23 - 00;09;24;07
Speaker 1
And you bring down that time, You know what I mean? Now they're probably two or three log in that room for any more.

00;09;24;10 - 00;09;24;29
Speaker 3
Did you.

00;09;24;29 - 00;09;26;29
Speaker 4
Dog in there then while you were working on them or.

00;09;26;29 - 00;09;47;26
Speaker 1
What. Yeah. You know I've you level and I had pamphlets set up a 45 degree. I dropped all my 45 degrees now legal archeology to get our you know, no problem.

00;09;47;29 - 00;09;50;21
Speaker 5
I thought we could not do that with a crack.

00;09;50;23 - 00;09;53;24
Speaker 1
Well a lot of my did.

00;09;53;26 - 00;09;58;03
Speaker 5
I get awfully. You can't you.

00;09;58;06 - 00;10;03;17
Speaker 4
That's a lot of skill to fight one of those.

00;10;03;19 - 00;10;06;06
Speaker 1
Yeah it is an accurate Yeah.

00;10;06;09 - 00;10;09;22

00;10;21;28 - 00;10;27;21
Speaker 1
No. You had without any back here.

00;10;27;23 - 00;10;29;12

Speaker 5
Yeah.

00;10;34;13 - 00;11;03;10
Speaker 1
Well, there's been times really when there was more activity in here and there is now. One time there was would be a number of electric coming here. I long and then a big red yellow metal part get go where they all break their and that broke that cycle and then now look at it and how much of that anymore just type they're going through their home country.

00;11;03;17 - 00;11;09;12
Speaker 4
Well I think that threat to trail now the announcer broke the cycle again.

00;11;09;15 - 00;11;10;29
Speaker 3
Yeah it's you.

00;11;11;00 - 00;11;16;02

00;11;16;04 - 00;11;17;09
Speaker 1
I'm pretty bad in the guard.

00;11;17;17 - 00;11;19;14
Speaker 4
Yeah, I guess so.

00;11;19;16 - 00;11;21;08
Speaker 1
Yeah, I am Banana I that time.

00;11;21;08 - 00;11;22;11
Speaker 3
It's real tough.

00;11;22;13 - 00;11;25;05
Speaker 1
But I'm going down with it over. You know.

00;11;25;08 - 00;11;36;23
Speaker 4
Earl was talking about, you know, after all the time, because there were some real nice guy rock masonry, you know, just right down here, just a short life. And that's all fake now.

00;11;37;02 - 00;11;39;07
Speaker 3
yeah.

00;11;39;09 - 00;11;55;18
Speaker 4
Water took it all out. So he was saying something about coming to him. So your barn just stayed on this side? Yeah, well, you know, and sort of letting that go. I think that's what, you know.

00;11;55;20 - 00;12;01;08
Speaker 3
They can't get back. There's just one bluff down here and you can get.

00;12;01;10 - 00;12;09;17
Speaker 1
Up this side. ABDUL-JABBAR You know, it really take money to do that. And they went there over the top there halfway, got big. And boy.

00;12;09;19 - 00;12;15;25
Speaker 4
You you talking about crossing the road, have to build one bridge.

00;12;15;27 - 00;12;22;15

00;12;22;18 - 00;12;24;23

To go they never had downgraded started.

00;12;30;00 - 00;12;31;14
Speaker 3
From from here.

00;12;31;17 - 00;12;53;23
Speaker 1
And soldier bar but there was one guard and told your bar to go to work quick round through it out blast. Well to give that up but they come down they could be a trail shot through there. Sure. But it'd be quite piece these construction work. But it, it's solid rock and it must be half mile per mile.

00;12;53;26 - 00;12;56;07
Speaker 4
And I'm going to have to go down.

00;12;56;09 - 00;12;57;18
Speaker 3
To the.

00;12;57;21 - 00;12;59;22
Speaker 4
Well pay the guard sometime.

00;12;59;22 - 00;13;00;29
Speaker 3
I'll just take a look.

00;13;01;02 - 00;13;11;13
Speaker 1
Yeah, well, I did a lot of work on it, you know, and I figured they had it. But I get this water Got the high this year, then just, well, probably goofy about work every minute before.

00;13;11;15 - 00;13;17;14

Speaker 1
Know, they could have got out on that. I knew I wouldn't know it for that.

00;13;36;22 - 00;13;39;16
Speaker 3
It was a place to go down there to wash it out.

00;13;39;16 - 00;13;44;23
Speaker 1
But I don't think there's any place there would what you could probably go up over it, but if it had.

00;13;44;25 - 00;13;56;04
Speaker 3
I know there was a back. I ran into a backpacker down there and he said he just had a heck of a time myself getting over one place there on the trail, on board.

00;13;56;07 - 00;13;58;15
Speaker 1
I'm going to number over.

They've got and Dixie they've got an awful lot of this stuff and Jack has got it you know and his daughter, he had one one daughter and she married Mel Holman who's now over in the regional office in Region one or in Missoula. And he's become pretty interested in the history. You know, they have artifacts just all over, You know, of course, that was an old mining area and of course you have her, but they have the old tobacco plug carried to perfect shape, you know, and the old hand coffee grinder and and.

00;17;47;08 - 00;17;58;23
Speaker 1
We had one of these up near Cavin Creek to buy it owned at that time, gave it to it and we were going out and get it for we get up there to get it. They pulled out the whole farm, covered up one on them. We do it.

00;17;59;00 - 00;18;16;11
Speaker 5
Well. This is the coffee grinder that was here and they had evidently have a bag and it hooked in here. And I think I saw one somewhere that had the background and in some, you know, museum or anything. Yeah. That was here.

00;18;16;11 - 00;18;40;00
Speaker 1
Her name is quite a character, you know, as a, as a guy way back in the early days and they had back Stringer and go outside and take these items up there out one and it was a 30 day trip and he had some of the male brothers and people like that in their club or I don't know, guess where he entered in the picture.

00;18;40;00 - 00;19;05;28
Speaker 1
But he was a sportswriter or something. And we have all the car fun and relative to that, you know and he gave some of them sent them an eight hour man record and it was quite a gun back in that time. And we got the car in there with our fishing tackle entered at our now the wooden Remington Patrick box and things like that.

00;19;05;28 - 00;19;19;20
Speaker 1
But we have a correspondent on that and we have sheets out of the tabloid of the The New York Times, I believe it was showing him and these cougar dogs and things like that, you know, but that stuff is all that crunk.

00;19;19;22 - 00;19;31;06
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah. Well, that I was just when I was back, I guess two weeks ago, I went up and got all the information that we.

00;19;31;06 - 00;19;31;28
Speaker 5
Had.

00;19;32;01 - 00;19;47;17
Speaker 4
On the Taylor Ranch, you know, and the agreements and so on, and tried to go through and and read, find out what what I could, you know, before we came down. That's where I came across the doctor's name on it.

00;19;47;19 - 00;19;48;26
Speaker 3
Yeah. Yeah.

00;19;48;29 - 00;19;55;25
Speaker 4
He hadn't give given $500 to be put into a trust for just what you're talking about.

00;19;55;25 - 00;19;56;20
Speaker 1
Yeah I know.

00;19;56;22 - 00;20;07;20
Speaker 4
And, and of course when Erickson was here and so on, like, all that sort of went down the tubes back, we sort of step backwards there for a while and. Yeah.

00;20;07;22 - 00;20;13;05
Speaker 1
Yeah. You, we agree with you on that.

00;20;13;08 - 00;20;15;21
Speaker 4
That's too bad. We have to agree on that.

00;20;15;24 - 00;20;18;05
Speaker 5
That he was a strange person.

00;20;18;05 - 00;20;19;22
Speaker 1
Yeah, very much. Yeah. We hear.

00;20;19;22 - 00;20;20;13
Speaker 5
Something.

00;20;20;14 - 00;20;21;16
Speaker 3
He's a biologist.

00;20;21;17 - 00;20;28;01
Speaker 5
And something in his life, I guess. But he had to do like. children.

00;20;28;04 - 00;20;49;21
Speaker 4
I didn't know the children. I, of course I was working for the Forest Service at that time and when they first made the first presentation at the University of the Wilderness Research, I went up and I taped it because I wanted to, you know, see where they were going, you know, because I was interested and.

00;20;49;24 - 00;20;52;11
Speaker 3
Well, naturally.

00;20;52;13 - 00;20;56;20
Speaker 5
He brought the two children in here. And then we got.

00;20;56;21 - 00;21;09;20
Speaker 1
Like, these names, you know, the thing operated for what it was intended for in the air card. I know about two doctor. Their dogs went out again. I'm kind of a doctor out of here.

00;21;09;22 - 00;21;21;09
Speaker 3
I'm curious a little bit about about what the discussions, early discussions were with the university on intention of abusing what they intended to do with it.

00;21;21;12 - 00;21;43;22
Speaker 1
We were like, that was the intention right from the very start was the only the only students that were going for that advanced stuff would be in here and and they would carry on research here. They got a lot of things here and research, you know, now they could be running a study on energy, not things. And here they they wanted to go for range.

00;21;43;25 - 00;21;45;09
Speaker 1
You know I don't want.

00;21;45;11 - 00;22;20;01
Speaker 4
Or peak I know peak has got a proposal to do a long range training study on the Shrub species here, you know, relative to the range. And, he's also going to be able to tie that in somewhat with some of the early data that are not gathered, you know, on the species composition in here. And then Dr. Ables, at least everything's tentative now, but he said up above is proposed on a sheep study, you know, and.

00;22;20;01 - 00;22;29;05
Speaker 5
Who are the young man who came in here and down did the study of the range practice and.

00;22;29;16 - 00;22;33;02
Speaker 4
that's a chart.

00;22;33;04 - 00;22;39;15
Speaker 5
Well, thank you. Here, young fellow. Here.

00;22;39;18 - 00;22;40;19
Speaker 3
I don't know the cattle, but.

00;22;40;19 - 00;22;41;22
Speaker 4
Boy, was he dark headed.

00;22;41;22 - 00;22;43;26
Speaker 5
Is dark here.

00;22;43;28 - 00;22;45;01
Speaker 3
So, you know.

00;22;45;05 - 00;22;45;29
Speaker 5
No, no, no.

00;22;46;06 - 00;22;48;19
Speaker 3
That was with the group.

00;22;48;21 - 00;22;50;05
Speaker 5
Yeah, we know he.

00;22;50;05 - 00;22;52;12
Speaker 4
Was with Morris. Yeah.

00;22;52;14 - 00;22;58;05
Speaker 5
Yeah, we. They lived here for two years. We know that they lived down here.

00;22;58;08 - 00;22;59;13
Speaker 1
They were in the barn, and.

00;22;59;18 - 00;23;01;13
Speaker 3
I say.

00;23;01;15 - 00;23;05;24
Speaker 5
Yes. We're a very long bungalow down.

00;23;05;27 - 00;23;13;00
Speaker 3
Like everything goes right. They'll have a six year study. It's a six year study with the doctor. And most of them.

00;23;13;02 - 00;23;16;04
Speaker 5
Think, you know, it was due in here and, and.

00;23;16;07 - 00;23;20;23
Speaker 4
Well, things have been sort of a situation of flux for a lot of.

00;23;20;25 - 00;23;23;21
Speaker 3
Bit of turmoil. And we're not quite sure.

00;23;23;23 - 00;23;25;11
Speaker 1
Well.

00;23;25;13 - 00;23;57;18
Speaker 3
They said that well, the Wilderness Research Center I'm actually director of the Wilderness Research Center, essentially the same thing as Erickson was, except that I have no responsibility at all. But the ranch now just that's that's in the dean's hands and right now it's just horses. We don't know yet how common areas are, but we don't want to get down here and talk with you to find out a little bit about how you history of the area, how you feel about it.

00;23;57;25 - 00;24;02;08
Speaker 3
And you'd like to see, you know, these things go by, helps me understand.

00;24;02;10 - 00;24;30;03
Speaker 1
Well, that was the intended purpose to start with their research center and red students and yeah, good. If the main thing was actually the natural environment when people were finally doing it and in the name of God natural environment, they certainly got it. There's been no change here near here. And what this wilderness area is going to do to it, I wouldn't know.

00;24;30;03 - 00;24;36;13
Speaker 1
I presume that Congress will establish it in the wilderness area. Yet when they'll get to it by, I wouldn't know.

00;24;36;15 - 00;24;40;04
Speaker 4
Right now things are pretty politically tied.

00;24;40;06 - 00;24;41;00
Speaker 3
I guess.

00;24;41;02 - 00;25;02;05
Speaker 1
Yeah, I know it is. We've had people here that would they from California that really had to know that not know what the problem before anyone thank you it's something you know going on but it's all American air and ground on monitoring right.

00;25;02;10 - 00;25;02;23
Speaker 3
Yeah.

00;25;02;25 - 00;25;05;24
Speaker 1
And you couldn't blame everybody.

00;25;05;24 - 00;25;30;11
Speaker 3
Have you ever had any discussions with anybody about possibility of a foundation relative to the air? You know what I think? No, what I was thinking about is the one time I was possibly trying to set up a foundation for people who are interested in in promoting research and in the air, could put their money and know that it would go to research because it would go into foundation.

00;25;30;11 - 00;25;35;05
Speaker 3
And the only work off of the interest and the capital was always there and it just gave for.

00;25;35;07 - 00;25;55;08
Speaker 5
This could have been talked about. But you see really we wouldn't have been contacted. But I think that they knew that there was something along this line, maybe even back as far as Morris was in here when Morris was living here, there one year.

00;25;55;10 - 00;25;58;21
Speaker 1
They think that's what I think.

00;25;58;24 - 00;25;59;15
Speaker 5
Sure.

00;25;59;17 - 00;26;00;24
Speaker 1
I have in mind.

00;26;00;24 - 00;26;07;08
Speaker 3
I'm sure you know, what I would think would be the. Yeah, yeah. The best way to handle something. Yeah.

00;26;07;10 - 00;26;36;13
Speaker 5
So now, Mrs. Stern, to your father, if the name should be able to, what would you say? Make a donation, make donations. And he knows many people who would be interested in this sort of thing. And of course, when he came in here, he was he is a contractor in, say, California, and he was interested in buildings and thought they needed it.

00;26;36;15 - 00;26;48;29
Speaker 5
And here and he has the money nearby here. But that went by the board. I mean, it where there no, it didn't seem to be anybody to get a hold of to talk to.

00;26;49;03 - 00;26;56;25
Speaker 3
Yes, this is the problem. Yeah, they know why you know everybody how you know, Big Red Bull runs Red Bull.

00;26;57;01 - 00;27;03;05
Speaker 1
Yeah. And we know right where you are and mark up the she can't be that her whole family in the air.

00;27;03;07 - 00;27;04;00
Speaker 5
They knew.

00;27;04;02 - 00;27;18;28
Speaker 1
Fred Bowman. yeah. And they were going to come through But he's with a Northern Trust and they're hanging by the cab cable. He's, they're represented. This is their district out here and everything. He comes out here, why not take it?

00;27;19;03 - 00;27;21;00
Speaker 4
Why would you be.

00;27;21;00 - 00;27;33;11
Speaker 3
Interested in if we could put together a foundation, Would you be interested in in helping us in terms of contacts with people you know, who are interested in being the ranch itself and have been in.

00;27;33;11 - 00;27;39;25
Speaker 5
Here? I can't see any reason why not, You know.

00;27;39;29 - 00;27;41;05
Speaker 3
Not if we were an agent.

00;27;41;05 - 00;27;42;08
Speaker 1
Where we could. You know.

00;27;42;10 - 00;27;49;07
Speaker 3
It's just like, of course do of course bonding with them, telling them that we do have something available as well.

00;27;49;07 - 00;28;05;06
Speaker 5
What we've been through the Dr. Loveland also, they brought a doctor and another man in here who was interested in school in Southern California, and his name was that could.

00;28;05;08 - 00;28;06;07
Speaker 3
Was.

00;28;06;09 - 00;28;15;00
Speaker 5
Sent some good All of these things could be you know, you one will have to do another.

00;28;15;06 - 00;28;28;22
Speaker 3
I've talked to the foundation people at the university and they said that could be set up right now. I see this is the only way that we can we can get money that will continually work.

00;28;28;24 - 00;28;31;01
Speaker 5
To keep.

00;28;31;04 - 00;28;32;14
Speaker 3
It any other way.

00;28;32;14 - 00;28;38;19
Speaker 1
We give you a grant here on the ground there and it's right away a backlog right there.

00;28;38;21 - 00;28;49;10
Speaker 5
Yeah. Yeah. And the doctors spent the $500 there it is somewhere up on a shelf or something. Nobody knows what in the world to do with it or where to put it.

00;28;49;12 - 00;29;05;13
Speaker 4
Well, when I went through the correspondence here today, because I'm interested in the historical aspects and, and the interpreting potential of this area. And I asked I couldn't get back in to see that in name. But I ask is what is bothering me.

00;29;05;17 - 00;29;06;24
Speaker 3
I mean he's been.

00;29;06;26 - 00;29;30;19
Speaker 4
The administrative assistant or something and he does all the physical stuff there. And I said, Well, would you find out about this? Well, the trust fund is there, say, and it mentioned in one of the letters about the taping, you know, of you all. And that's why I talked to a couple other people up there and they said, yeah, that they were going to do this, you know, but there's been something that they were going to do and it was never done.

00;29;30;19 - 00;29;38;09
Speaker 4
And that's why I was surprised when I asked you last night if Dr. Loveland, you know, and you said, certainly he stopped by and and.

00;29;38;11 - 00;29;41;14
Speaker 5
That I think they were down a very kind of couple of a day.

00;29;41;17 - 00;29;45;27
Speaker 1
And when he came back and.

00;29;46;00 - 00;30;14;00
Speaker 5
The way we became acquainted, that was that Bamberg brought him into a monumental group and dropped them off manager for the park, each at the park and they started down the street. And with that they went over into the Craigs and all around. And then when they where do they think they're taking me? Take him back out. They will take him out of here one evening and a one morning.

00;30;14;02 - 00;30;30;07
Speaker 5
So the Loveland's came up here and they wanted to camp downtown, which was just what they did, but did give him the mayor's a card and I guess that was the best car in the area before 29th.

00;30;30;09 - 00;30;42;09
Speaker 1
It got to be we were down below here. I was doing other work on a fighter plane down there and he was stationed and she just got a big red.

00;30;42;09 - 00;30;44;24
Speaker 3
Side about like an so.

00;30;44;26 - 00;30;59;15
Speaker 1
They came up and that way she gave him the red side. And so then they came on up there and I didn't come. Garden problems mark up. I don't want that. So that that's where you met them. And then last year I think probably on our out, we were in the Yukon.

00;30;59;21 - 00;31;02;19
Speaker 5
I think we weren't in car last summer It was the number.

00;31;02;22 - 00;31;03;28
Speaker 1
Yeah.

00;31;04;00 - 00;31;22;01
Speaker 5
We didn't see them last year. I don't know. They're I'm sorry they didn't count. Yeah. Because it's summer I think the year they come in McCall call. I don't believe that they probably a rental condominium type thing out there where they camp.

00;31;22;03 - 00;31;26;09
Speaker 4
And how old would you guess that they are.

00;31;26;12 - 00;31;27;27
Speaker 5
1150.

00;31;28;01 - 00;31;28;20
Speaker 3
50.

00;31;28;23 - 00;31;33;14
Speaker 5
004 50 ish. Yeah. You can't really tell about it.

00;31;33;15 - 00;31;34;02
Speaker 4
Yeah.

00;31;34;05 - 00;31;37;03
Speaker 3
She's still active, practicing.

00;31;37;05 - 00;31;59;28
Speaker 5
I assumes though, right? I don't know that either. They practice, they live in Hollywood and then but I fear that old. I don't know if you've been back on your back very far and they were doing well. They have grown children that are married, so I'm still married in their fifties now.

00;32;00;04 - 00;32;10;06
Speaker 4
When were they through here then, roughly? I don't remember the date on the letter, but that was their letter was shortly probably a year or two thereafter that they were through.

00;32;10;08 - 00;32;11;25
Speaker 5
You know, it would have been in that time.

00;32;11;26 - 00;32;15;21
Speaker 4
In the fifties then, you know, 60 or 60.

00;32;15;24 - 00;32;16;14
Speaker 3
60.

00;32;16;16 - 00;32;24;04
Speaker 5
Yeah. Because I think it was there after the university in 68 or 66.

00;32;24;06 - 00;32;26;08
Speaker 3
I think it was 1968.

00;32;26;08 - 00;32;40;15
Speaker 5
I think. And there it would have been before than.

00;32;40;17 - 00;32;44;17
Speaker 4
Well.

00;32;44;20 - 00;33;04;20
Speaker 3
And is a problem right now as far as getting research going in here. It's just the money has just dried up in the stock market, you know, to get with money for research, the kind of lot of the kind of research we like to do here, we have to go to federal agencies or go to foundations and the foundations that really get hurt and the stock market.

00;33;04;20 - 00;33;06;01
Speaker 1
Yeah.

00;33;06;04 - 00;33;06;28
Speaker 3
That's just what.

00;33;06;28 - 00;33;17;13
Speaker 1
I get out of that. So we've been hurt a little too, but we're have not been long for years. We're not hurt. Nobody gives.

00;33;17;15 - 00;33;23;04
Speaker 5
Us. All right. I think probably more students in here now.

00;33;23;06 - 00;33;25;20
Speaker 3
We would like to see the facilities, right?

00;33;25;22 - 00;33;26;19
Speaker 5
Yeah. Yeah.

00;33;26;19 - 00;33;40;26
Speaker 3
It's a shame for it to sit and nothing to be happening here. We've we would like to to get some cooperative research in here with the archeology is the historians do. we are coming.

00;33;40;28 - 00;33;43;20
Speaker 5
Forward to archeologists in here.

00;33;43;22 - 00;33;45;15
Speaker 4
From Idaho State.

00;33;45;18 - 00;33;57;13
Speaker 5
One and they come down by the name of Max and the other boy I think came from.

00;33;57;15 - 00;33;58;18
Speaker 3
Aggie.

00;33;58;21 - 00;34;11;08
Speaker 5
Either. Yeah, right. You meet too many people here and they're either Pennsylvania or Ohio. Now, I'm not here. He was a smaller of them.

00;34;11;10 - 00;34;12;21
Speaker 4
Were they together.

00;34;12;23 - 00;34;23;27
Speaker 5
The man from Tokyo? I was that exception. I got like, six or five and very slender. And he's name is Max.

00;34;23;29 - 00;34;26;02
Speaker 3
Okay, Yeah, I'll.

00;34;26;04 - 00;34;30;04
Speaker 5
But I don't think he would be heard from Dr. Sprague.

00;34;30;07 - 00;34;37;13
Speaker 4
Who is head of the department is head of the Department of Archeology and Anthropology at the University of they're.

00;34;37;15 - 00;34;37;25
Speaker 5
Here.

00;34;38;01 - 00;34;53;01
Speaker 4
At the university is and he's tied in very close to Swanson down here in Pocatello. And they've got to I talk to Dr. Sprague, and he's very interested in coming in now.

00;34;53;06 - 00;35;04;26
Speaker 5
They came in here and they walked off on the side of recruit, picked up a couple of beer of wheat, shipped out around here.

00;35;04;28 - 00;35;05;15
Speaker 1
They they were.

00;35;05;21 - 00;35;16;22
Speaker 3
You like those guys just destined to be just, you know, magnets in their eyes? Yeah. Yeah. They can walk along. You can step right over in these and how can you step on that one.

00;35;16;25 - 00;35;16;29
Speaker 5
And.

00;35;17;06 - 00;35;19;14
Speaker 1
Just get up.

00;35;19;17 - 00;35;21;01
Speaker 4
There. Yeah, well, it's like.

00;35;21;04 - 00;35;30;21
Speaker 1
What was a beer bag is full of beer. And we brought down.

00;35;30;21 - 00;35;35;06
Speaker 3
Here in a slide and.

00;35;35;08 - 00;35;59;13
Speaker 1
We've got an in a brain now, we still got the model that I guess they even predates the sheet beater. They're still there. They, they haven't, they they haven't. The area formation. They're just like this really. You know, just like, And their obsidian and midnight obsidian on their own position.

00;35;59;15 - 00;36;00;02
Speaker 4
Yeah.

00;36;00;05 - 00;36;05;09
Speaker 5
Yeah. We were in Wisconsin one time. I thought,

00;36;05;12 - 00;36;05;23
Speaker 2
Well, I.

00;36;06;01 - 00;36;19;11
Speaker 5
Hope they have it in there. And it said that those were Columbia River Indian spearheads. And I was just like,

00;36;19;13 - 00;36;30;05
Speaker 3
Okay. I could have come up in this far. I could have followed them the, the salmon or something up the streams or somewhere. Well,

00;36;30;07 - 00;36;31;15
Speaker 4
In some of the work that they did and.

00;36;31;18 - 00;36;34;17
Speaker 3
Pocatello, they're shows that,

00;36;34;19 - 00;36;56;12
Speaker 4
We had about a 500 year climatic cycle in this area, and that the life film on these cycles in habitation in here was around the 655 or 6500 foot elevation zone, you know, when it was in the woods. And that at that time it was Artemisia. I was in.

00;36;56;12 - 00;36;57;12
Speaker 3
This with the upper.

00;36;57;12 - 00;37;24;16
Speaker 4
Areas were sagebrush Sea. And then so it was was much drier than it is now. And that was right at the right at the break between the sagebrush and your timber and where you had your water. There were a lot of these areas down here were probably not running strange. But at the end you run the edge of the timber in, the sagebrush, you know that we've been running stream and that's where the habitation was.

00;37;24;16 - 00;37;33;08
Speaker 4
And which means that the summer or the winter wintering down here would have been, you know, a snap compared to where it is today.

00;37;33;08 - 00;37;38;01
Speaker 5
Yeah, well, you know, where the Indian peoples are going to be.

00;37;38;04 - 00;37;39;10
Speaker 3
I just.

00;37;39;10 - 00;37;57;02
Speaker 4
I didn't get that far and was observing. I haven't seen the well I blindfolded far, but I just landed there to check the field out. I mean, I haven't been down on the other side to see the petroglyphs on the other side. Now, are they quite a ways up?

00;37;57;05 - 00;38;05;09
Speaker 5
No, they're only a short distance between the Oak Creek Bridge there. Good Creek. No problem. And that's the.

00;38;05;16 - 00;38;07;06
Speaker 4
Is there much vertical.

00;38;07;27 - 00;38;13;14
Speaker 5
Right here. about like 10 minutes or rocky down there from here?

00;38;13;17 - 00;38;15;21
Speaker 3
No, no, no. So.

00;38;15;24 - 00;38;16;23
Speaker 5
Yeah, but they're about.

00;38;16;23 - 00;38;22;24
Speaker 1
An hour down where you are. You probably make a five minute hike here.

00;38;22;25 - 00;38;26;26
Speaker 2
You are not well. Yeah.

00;38;26;28 - 00;38;35;22
Speaker 1
That's right. Down where that big wide down is. You're right in the grass in the garden. And they're on the opposite side in the trail. And they're. They're preserved. Usually they're.

00;38;35;22 - 00;38;39;18
Speaker 3
Or are they from that? You know, you got that big deep hole.

00;38;39;21 - 00;38;40;26
Speaker 1
Well on the log and you got.

00;38;40;26 - 00;38;42;11
Speaker 3
To go on down there, on, down.

00;38;42;13 - 00;38;48;11
Speaker 1
Right in the garden you know, where get caught up like that on both sides. And you're right across from the big water. Yeah.

00;38;48;14 - 00;38;57;29
Speaker 5
Yeah, I know that you can get a big picture either from, between eight and 830 in the morning when the sun comes in. They're just right early.

00;38;58;05 - 00;39;02;01
Speaker 1
That be in the summertime. I don't know one that will be there and I'll probably wouldn't hit in there at all.

00;39;02;01 - 00;39;08;10
Speaker 5
Now I got to get there now in the summer. You have to get down there earlier in the.

00;39;08;13 - 00;39;12;00
Speaker 3
Day to one of the pictures of.

00;39;12;03 - 00;39;15;26
Speaker 5
Animals, sheep and a lot of blind.

00;39;15;29 - 00;39;36;02
Speaker 1
All of those here got a lot of lined. I don't know whether they were calculating something, marking up the game paper or what they were doing, but that's in all of and practically any of these caves here have some in them. If you know where the cave is, but not in Smokey the Bear, nor are they that far down in that one.

00;39;36;02 - 00;39;36;29
Speaker 1
Not very far down.

00;39;36;29 - 00;39;40;16
Speaker 4
Here on on this side of that.

00;39;40;18 - 00;39;42;17
Speaker 1
Trail time.

00;39;42;19 - 00;39;53;15
Speaker 4
I just when we went up here, I looked back across, you know, where I actually saw the mule deer up here. And I would just look and I saw there's a bluff area here. I didn't even look with the glasses, but they were some.

00;39;53;21 - 00;39;56;18
Speaker 1
There's nothing on this side.

00;39;56;21 - 00;39;57;02
Speaker 5
That.

00;39;57;09 - 00;40;00;23
Speaker 1
There is teepee over the, you know, down here.

00;40;00;23 - 00;40;01;20
Speaker 5
There's a young.

00;40;01;23 - 00;40;22;25
Speaker 1
Guy on that side. On this side? Not just around the point here, but down a little bit farther and deep. They hold in there and there's more than here with a B, How are they getting them? A Very fine of an agreement, though, that you may wonder. They were getting a great big dog that. yeah.

00;40;22;27 - 00;40;40;00
Speaker 1
And got a great big, big down here. We got we've got lots of beef and then we got that one whole block of experience and probably did get em or more. And then I got one perfect bird point the lair and didn't get perfect.

00;40;40;03 - 00;40;41;12
Speaker 4
The opposite. Yeah.

00;40;41;15 - 00;40;52;20
Speaker 1
Yeah. I think it up in the sand is down here. Well, we're in a creek wash it right up against the trailer And I did. And there.

00;40;52;23 - 00;41;10;16
Speaker 5
But you know, I suppose we'd walk around that trail going around the farm here hundreds of times, and then all of a sudden, my walk around in there was the blue had been. Yes, ma'am. That's all I've ever.

00;41;10;18 - 00;41;13;13
Speaker 4
Spraying would be. We're just going to have to get and.

00;41;13;14 - 00;41;29;15
Speaker 1
Play every time. I would bait up the garden here, I find the stadium never down any place near what it doesn't do. They're checking our top again and not up. And also you have none or we had the potato patch down there.

00;41;29;18 - 00;41;35;12
Speaker 4
Now it was just sort of a natural little band right here. And, you know, okay, well, then that explains it. Yeah. Yeah.

00;41;35;12 - 00;41;38;05
Speaker 5
It would be sitting right there and remarked.

00;41;38;07 - 00;41;46;16
Speaker 3
Yeah, I'd like to get up sometime before we leave to just kind of walk around the place. Much of the time it was here.

00;41;46;19 - 00;42;03;06
Speaker 4
This was 18, you see, because the date was on this side, 1894, February 16th is when this was banded with Winchester Arms. Yeah. And the calendar was a 3855 38.

00;42;03;08 - 00;42;04;00
Speaker 1
Yeah. But I don't.

00;42;04;08 - 00;42;06;17
Speaker 3
Know what.

00;42;06;20 - 00;42;13;18
Speaker 4
Though. Anyway, I've done some. That was great but they do, they got it sandblasted and it's real fine.

00;42;13;20 - 00;42;15;21
Speaker 3
In your sandblast. Yes.

00;42;15;21 - 00;42;17;10
Speaker 4
And then they put it in copper sulfate.

00;42;17;13 - 00;42;18;14
Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah.

00;42;18;17 - 00;42;53;04
Speaker 4
Which had always been the sandblasted bare metal and the copper sulfate. It makes it so that they're writing here, you can read it perfectly and the copper sulfate artificially ages it and then you covered it with a polymer emulsion spray so that it won't oxidize anymore, you know, But then you have here the artifact which looks old, you know, but it's not quite as, you know, I might add, what You're doing you take a Yeah, I've got some of some axes back here that I found, you know.

00;42;53;07 - 00;42;59;19
Speaker 3
And some that are really old and.

00;42;59;21 - 00;43;03;13
Speaker 1
Well, we've got practically all of a.

00;43;03;15 - 00;43;06;12
Speaker 5
Lot more coffee.

00;43;06;14 - 00;43;07;00
Speaker 1
Better.

00;43;07;02 - 00;43;07;11
Speaker 3
Wine.

00;43;07;11 - 00;43;23;02
Speaker 1
Thank you. Complaining, inviting. Know what I'm there today. There's a neighbor branding iron right there. This one. And you know, we found that. All right. and I just picked it up, brought it home. I had it in the car at one.

00;43;23;02 - 00;43;27;20
Speaker 3
Time, there was practically.

00;43;27;27 - 00;43;43;18
Speaker 1
No doubt that they did the right thing for the creek. Anybody got in trouble, they brought it down here and you take it the and when they were was all the ballots up there. One of the on it. But you know that it was in perfect and we let that go with the board and we tried that we should.

00;43;43;20 - 00;43;46;06
Speaker 4
We did a double action.

00;43;46;08 - 00;43;47;27
Speaker 1
I don't know.

00;43;48;00 - 00;43;50;20
Speaker 4
I mean did it blow when you lift it up and blow, you push down.

00;43;50;20 - 00;43;51;21
Speaker 5
But I couldn't tell you they.

00;43;51;28 - 00;43;52;15
Speaker 1
They so.

00;43;52;15 - 00;43;55;18
Speaker 4
Well though here you know, pretty rare buried.

00;43;55;22 - 00;43;57;17
Speaker 1
The oil This was an old but it's.

00;43;57;17 - 00;43;58;15
Speaker 5
Taking care of it.

00;43;58;15 - 00;44;27;12
Speaker 1
But we had moonshadow and that had been well taken care of, you know then of course she had went pot, but it was right beside a big rocket. They don't see the old ordinary right up in the old big cabin or the creek. And, you know, there's that they didn't we didn't make no or an ordinary hammer and make that.

00;44;27;14 - 00;44;28;17
Speaker 3
Or to do it.

00;44;28;19 - 00;44;30;01
Speaker 4
I've never.

00;44;30;03 - 00;44;31;16
Speaker 1
Been out here That's that.

00;44;31;18 - 00;44;39;19
Speaker 3
Bird you know. Right. And so you start yeah.

00;44;40;04 - 00;44;42;10
Speaker 1

Speaker 3
My brother right there.

00;44;43;28 - 00;44;45;11

Speaker 1
You have no tongue they make you need them I'm sure.

00;44;56;12 - 00;45;07;13
Speaker 4
No, I've never I've watched fellas that knew what they were doing, you know, and it's neat to watch. Well, it's like anything that somebody knows. What are you doing? You know, it's really neat to watch.

00;45;07;15 - 00;45;11;01
Speaker 5
It's frustrating if you try.

00;45;11;23 - 00;45;34;24
Speaker 3
that's the thing I remember most about an don't. I had a3b in the farm out there and he had a big old board and yeah, and yeah, the walls are just lined with tulips like this, you know. And so now we used to have a ball, this one of the fire that they never did they quite high powered and tried to make that you know so one of those childhood memories that you just never forget.

00;45;35;10 - 00;45;37;26
Speaker 5
is there for now. Yeah.

00;45;37;28 - 00;45;42;13
Speaker 1
Well I don't have a problem here at one time and it's always hard.

00;45;42;15 - 00;45;42;25
Speaker 3
You.

00;45;42;27 - 00;46;11;27
Speaker 1
Know, the fact that, you know, one, our statement was pretty good. They, they get away with it because they got caught. They had it. Gillman get away with that. It's no too hard that about now but and and now they don't they got away with Hardesty they had him put well this was the main trail in the country that this finer green ground it's the old trail in the country and go over down on.

00;46;12;00 - 00;46;13;03
Speaker 1
Anyhow, he took that.

00;46;13;10 - 00;46;14;19
Speaker 3
Button.

00;46;14;21 - 00;46;24;26
Speaker 1
And got away up here someplace and he said I was just coming in one day, the opening and they was going out the other night opened up on.

00;46;24;29 - 00;46;25;11
Speaker 2
The.

00;46;25;13 - 00;46;38;00
Speaker 1
Job. And Martin said, you know, if I get that a big gun, I killed him over, you know better than what you got to party for. Partridge Bloody in one of them. And the matter of record a little later, why a doctor dug it out of it? Not I'm here.

00;46;38;03 - 00;46;41;06
Speaker 2
I'm like,

00;46;41;08 - 00;46;45;05

Speaker 4
That A.T.M..

00;46;48;01 - 00;47;10;29
Speaker 1
Yeah, but even that, even the mile of, you know, some of these guy they wrote about him, depicted him, you know, with a gun man. And he once the even heard of anything, you get left alone, you know, you'd be a few river in a gutter. I get it. Showed me where he got mixed up with a grizzly bear down here and go Great Basin, Jordan.

00;47;10;29 - 00;47;18;16
Speaker 1
It's hard on it. Arms, I guess. Fine Gael barely might have been probably.

00;47;20;11 - 00;47;23;17
Speaker 4
What. How did he run onto him? I don't.

00;47;23;17 - 00;47;30;17
Speaker 1
Know. Probably. You know, I to come he got right growth curve. I'm sure you get Blanchard in that. All right. Good.

00;47;30;19 - 00;47;35;01
Speaker 4
I just want to maybe come up on the kill. Well, or we could been.

00;47;35;04 - 00;47;43;13

00;48;17;24 - 00;48;18;11
Speaker 3
Intriguing.

00;48;18;11 - 00;48;27;02

I, I think the scammers when the sewing machine was when it was hand-stitched later.

00;48;27;04 - 00;48;35;18
Speaker 5
Well you know, it really is because that was the I thought I carried all the time and it sharpens and I can help you get there.
