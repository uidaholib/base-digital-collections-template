00;00;22;04 - 00;00;23;13
John Smith
As we passed the Lewis.

00;00;23;13 - 00;00;24;09
Jess Taylor
Place, it was.

00;00;24;09 - 00;00;33;16
John Smith
Mainly across the river from the trail. And you would hardly know it was there. But I heard the dogs barking. David was a cougar hunter.

00;00;33;16 - 00;00;37;25
Jess Taylor
And had these cougar hound dog and I saw.

00;00;37;25 - 00;00;42;12

00;00;42;14 - 00;00;46;09
Jess Taylor
In April.

00;00;46;11 - 00;00;47;12
John Smith
I lived in the summer.

00;00;47;13 - 00;00;47;28

Time I started out.

00;00;51;17 - 00;00;52;03
Jess Taylor
With a pack.

00;00;52;03 - 00;00;54;21
John Smith
Mule and a saddle heart to go in.

00;00;54;21 - 00;00;55;26
Jess Taylor
And see this.

00;00;55;26 - 00;01;12;05
John Smith
Lewis place. And I went over seven feet of snow on Margaret. Great summer. It was about a four day trip and I ran the line. From where? From the MRI. Yeah.

00;01;12;07 - 00;01;18;06
Jess Taylor
And I can't get across the big creek.

00;01;18;08 - 00;01;19;14
John Smith
On what is known as Cliff.

00;01;19;14 - 00;01;20;29
Jess Taylor
Creek.

00;01;21;02 - 00;01;21;19
John Smith
And what over in.

00;01;21;19 - 00;01;25;23
Jess Taylor
Talk today, That evening, and ask him if he wished to sell his place.

00;01;25;27 - 00;01;33;09
John Smith
How do you know? They got across the creek and the. No, Breckenridge got a swing at the old swing. You know, not that hard. Yeah, him.

00;01;33;11 - 00;01;41;07
Jess Taylor
Didn't. And at that time, there was an old suspension bridge there, which has since been replaced.

00;01;41;10 - 00;01;43;05
John Smith
With a steel span.

00;01;43;07 - 00;01;51;26
Jess Taylor
Well, I asked Davis if he would sell his place, and the. He said that he did. And I asked him what he.

00;01;51;26 - 00;01;52;21
John Smith
Wanted for it.

00;01;52;21 - 00;01;55;10
Jess Taylor
And after I looked around a bit and he.

00;01;55;10 - 00;02;01;19
John Smith
Told me and I said, well, I'll make you a deposit on it now, and this fall.

00;02;01;21 - 00;02;05;04
Jess Taylor
I'll come in hunting and I'll be here.

00;02;05;06 - 00;02;06;16
John Smith
During the month of November.

00;02;06;16 - 00;02;06;27
Jess Taylor
And.

00;02;06;27 - 00;02;13;08
John Smith
We will complete the deal. They have had three administrators and it was necessary.

00;02;13;08 - 00;02;14;05
Jess Taylor
For these.

00;02;14;07 - 00;02;15;11
John Smith
Men as traders.

00;02;15;13 - 00;02;20;25
Jess Taylor
At least one of them, to bring the necessary papers, the they and so.

00;02;20;25 - 00;02;22;11
John Smith
On, and come in to witness.

00;02;22;11 - 00;02;22;29
Jess Taylor
The.

00;02;23;00 - 00;02;24;08
John Smith
Transfer.

00;02;24;10 - 00;02;28;29
Jess Taylor
And that's the way that I.

00;02;29;01 - 00;02;30;12
John Smith
Acquired.

00;02;30;14 - 00;02;32;00
Jess Taylor
What was then known as the.

00;02;32;00 - 00;02;40;00
John Smith
Lowest range. How old would Mr. Lewis have been about? And Mr. Lewis at that time was 92 years old.

00;02;40;02 - 00;02;50;11
Jess Taylor
And we moved. I moved in that fall after the after the hunting was over and.

00;02;50;13 - 00;02;52;23
John Smith
Dave had a small cabin. There was two cabins.

00;02;52;23 - 00;03;01;13
Jess Taylor
On the place. And I mentioned today that.

00;03;01;15 - 00;03;05;07
John Smith
The small cabin was but his as long as he wished to use it.

00;03;05;09 - 00;03;07;15
Jess Taylor
That he would live there just.

00;03;07;15 - 00;03;14;20
John Smith
As long as he worked. And we he was very active. He take care of himself.

00;03;14;22 - 00;03;17;28
Jess Taylor
Do his cooking and.

00;03;18;00 - 00;03;27;10
John Smith
We would help him a little with his work and so on. But they would very hard of hearing. But he could read without.

00;03;27;10 - 00;03;31;15
Jess Taylor
Glasses and.

00;03;31;18 - 00;03;36;21
John Smith
He had a very active memory. And I would go down of evenings and just sit down and then they would.

00;03;36;21 - 00;03;40;01
Jess Taylor
Start to tell me these various phases of his.

00;03;40;01 - 00;03;53;01
John Smith
Life. And to start with, there was a veteran of the Civil War, and he made one remark.

00;03;53;06 - 00;03;58;21
Jess Taylor
That was of interest. He said, I was in.

00;03;58;21 - 00;04;02;20
John Smith
The trenches before Vicksburg with Wild Bill Hickok.

00;04;02;22 - 00;04;03;27
Jess Taylor
And I.

00;04;03;27 - 00;04;04;04
John Smith
Can't.

00;04;04;04 - 00;04;05;16
Jess Taylor
Verify that.

00;04;05;18 - 00;04;27;18
John Smith
And he said that Wild Bill was, he thought, the finest rifle and pistol shot as lion at that time. And then we go on from there.

00;04;27;20 - 00;04;27;25
Jess Taylor
To.

00;04;27;25 - 00;04;42;25
John Smith
The Custer match. And the reason that the day was alive was that it was with Bantam. And they would all go.

00;04;42;27 - 00;04;43;17
Jess Taylor
I.

00;04;43;24 - 00;04;53;15
John Smith
Am under Reno, but Custer, the glory honor, he. He found more Indians. And then he could handle.

00;04;53;15 - 00;04;55;15
Jess Taylor
And as we know.

00;04;55;17 - 00;04;58;15
John Smith
At every one.

00;04;58;17 - 00;05;00;18
Jess Taylor
Out his.

00;05;00;20 - 00;05;17;20
John Smith
Soldiers and himself were killed. And they said it was in plain sight when he pulled in another, you know, he was a scout with Reno and. But they didn't touch Custer. They hadn't scalped.

00;05;17;20 - 00;05;20;01
Jess Taylor
Him. He was absolutely.

00;05;20;01 - 00;05;31;15
John Smith
Intact. Then we go on from there. Did he say what kind of a wound had killed General Custer? No, but it it was very likely a gunshot.

00;05;31;20 - 00;05;38;03
Jess Taylor
The Indians had had rifles, and of course, they also had.

00;05;38;05 - 00;05;53;29
John Smith
Bows and arrows. No, it was Mr. Lewis, a casual as a scout. Or was he part of the seventh Cavalry himself? Well, he was connected with the seventh Cavalry and his capacity was a scout.

00;05;54;06 - 00;05;54;16
Jess Taylor
With.

00;05;54;21 - 00;06;33;15
John Smith
Benton. Then we go on from there on down through the Indian marsh today. She paid her campaign, which was the next to the last campaign against the Indians in the United States, the last with the Apaches and there was this troop of soldiers coming down Big Creek. And they were several officers make standard coming from different directions, some of them coming from part my system.

00;06;33;15 - 00;06;59;23
John Smith
I'm from Fort Umatilla and but they lived carefully and they were feral. And there was Bonnard and Bonnard, though then there was cavalry all the way from Boise so far fighting. But they said it didn't. The scouts tried to persuade Catley that it wasn't the right thing to go down the bottom of the canyon.

00;06;59;28 - 00;07;00;15
Jess Taylor
Because.

00;07;00;15 - 00;07;33;05
John Smith
They were they were subject to ambush. He wanted to stay more with the the register as much as possible. But anyway, just about three miles above what is now the Taylor Ranch, why the Indians ambushed them there they get to they were crossing big quick and the Indians on the rocks here and they were just coming from this part into this little into this little grove of timber here.

00;07;33;13 - 00;07;45;13
John Smith
They told me exactly where everyone is, one of the old pits there. Yet it would have been between the Taylor Ranch and Cavin Creek. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Closer to the Taylor. Yeah. And, but you can still see the old.

00;07;45;13 - 00;07;54;00
Jess Taylor
Trail there where they crossed back and forth. Of course, they've got nutrients down to the blood, then they get the matter of fording the creek and.

00;07;54;02 - 00;08;09;16
John Smith
You know, or anything there. And now to mark the area where that ambush, if there's one pit that's. Yeah. And where's the pit in the get below the new trail. yeah. If you're in there sometime when.

00;08;09;21 - 00;08;10;10
Jess Taylor
I'm there I'll be.

00;08;10;18 - 00;08;11;10
John Smith
Please put.

00;08;11;12 - 00;08;12;05
Jess Taylor
On there and show.

00;08;12;05 - 00;08;24;26
John Smith
You the pit. Yeah. And just as they were coming out of Big Creek, why the Indians opened up on these soldiers.

00;08;24;26 - 00;08;27;14
Jess Taylor
And.

00;08;27;16 - 00;08;36;08
John Smith
They said it didn't look very good to him. I was in charge of the ammunition train at that time and also acting in the capacity of the scout. But I held back a little.

00;08;36;10 - 00;08;37;22
Jess Taylor
At.

00;08;37;24 - 00;08;56;26
John Smith
It yet didn't look good. And then they had black powder, of course, and fed pretty tone. The smoke got detected. The soldiers couldn't see the Indian and the Indians couldn't see the soldiers. So they broke off the engagement and the Indians faded back into rock. But they had they had wounded two soldiers.

00;08;56;29 - 00;08;58;28
Jess Taylor
And and they said.

00;08;58;28 - 00;09;05;13
John Smith
Well, why I didn't kill them all? I don't know how the Indians were aware at that time. Did he say which side of the group? Yes, they were.

00;09;05;13 - 00;09;06;10
Jess Taylor
On the.

00;09;06;13 - 00;09;08;23
John Smith
They were on the in the bluff near the point of.

00;09;08;23 - 00;09;09;26
Jess Taylor
Bluff comes down there.

00;09;09;27 - 00;09;20;21
John Smith
On the north side. Yeah. Yeah. And just as they were just coming through big. Great. See you got this part and they got them get that they were coming up out of the fort.

00;09;20;23 - 00;09;21;07
Jess Taylor
And.

00;09;21;14 - 00;09;44;24
John Smith
It's a matter of record that one lieutenant was the he was evidently probably out on his first trip and he got a little bit excited and they said when the smoke cleared, why this lieutenant had his arms around the tree. And the funny part of it was he was on the side. Next Indian on it's a matter of record.

00;09;44;27 - 00;10;13;03
John Smith
He was caught off guard it by So then they they come on down to Soldier bar and they got in another skirmish there and they were breaking up and Bernard was Captain Bernard was taking his cavalry going back to Fort Mighty. And you know, that that was quite a feat when you look at that country now, they had to go right through the mountain.

00;10;13;07 - 00;10;39;16
John Smith
Yeah, Yeah. This time of the year. That was, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah. 1870, 89. August 20th was when August 20th and you know. Yeah. And then Private Egan, he is buried there on Soldier by. Was he killed up there. Yeah. Is he buried there. He's buried down to the river in he. No by right.

00;10;39;16 - 00;10;41;15
Speaker 3
Under the monument they say.

00;10;41;17 - 00;10;48;23
John Smith
Why did they bury him clear up there. Well, he was killed. Was they were fighting up. Yeah. Right on. They'd gotten out of the creek down. They were backing up on there.

00;10;48;23 - 00;11;05;17
Speaker 3
Yeah. Yeah, they were evidently been camped there. But you see, that was the second expedition. They made three expeditions in there before they finally got this, this small band of Indians. Only about 30, 40 5 p.m.. And what was the. And the ambush, was it?

00;11;05;17 - 00;11;07;00
John Smith
If you talk to that.

00;11;07;03 - 00;11;28;22
Speaker 3
Then the three miles up from your end was part of the same expedition that Sergeant Egan was killed on? No, no. Were an expert out of the prior expedition. And that's only we created the rock. No, no Vinegar Hill. No. And it got its name from the fact that they forgot to pick up any water. The Indians are showing it, and they find it surrounded them on Vinegar Hill.

00;11;28;25 - 00;11;50;26
Speaker 3
Well, they went up there without any water, but they happen to have them vinegar. So they they drank the vinegar and and they had they threw out the soldiers and they said it didn't look good, Danny and Adams around it. But they finally slipped out during the night and made it out on back, you know, And I heard the second expedition in that that Private Egan withheld on the soldier.

00;11;50;26 - 00;11;59;04
Speaker 3
But it's important because if you read through some of the accounts, it does make clear that these were separate. Okay. Well, now we had a we had the radioman.

00;11;59;06 - 00;12;04;05
Unknown
Our copy of them, the back.

00;12;04;08 - 00;12;05;29
Speaker 3
Hit the Army.

00;12;06;02 - 00;12;55;06
