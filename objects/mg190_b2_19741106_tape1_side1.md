00;01;22;07 - 00;01;23;11

Speaker 2
We got a.

00;01;24;12 - 00;01;28;05
Speaker 5
Lot to be out here with. The certainly dollars. They're.

00;01;28;08 - 00;01;42;27
Speaker 2
We've got quite a big one, particularly on night cabin down there. So that when I first started to, when I have the rafters up in the shoulder column, the lock down their grip, I had that steel wagon with a 30 foot ridge out. yeah.

00;01;42;29 - 00;01;49;06
Speaker 3
And you you think you you still have a name?

00;01;49;09 - 00;01;53;07

Yeah, I think so. This we have a reason.

00;01;53;07 - 00;01;54;24
Speaker 2
We're a very.

00;01;54;26 - 00;02;12;18
Speaker 3
Concerned that it is. Maybe sometime on, we want to put in a kind of a history of the history of, of what has gone on here and all the development there. You know, then we can maybe get the negatives and make up your furniture here.

00;02;12;20 - 00;02;13;21
Speaker 2
We have a.

00;02;13;23 - 00;02;18;01

What's he doing? Dreaming about something.

00;02;26;09 - 00;02;39;17
Speaker 5
You know, you're right there. Those are two, you know, red flags that I kind of in my own mind. And then take it. That was so ideal that.

00;02;39;18 - 00;02;41;00
Speaker 4
Maybe it's catching the dream. And he.

00;02;41;00 - 00;02;46;17
Speaker 5
Was having a problem thinking of a.

00;02;46;22 - 00;02;54;13
Speaker 2
Girl. I can't recall the the time out. Every year there even there.

Speaker 2
Yeah. Nominate your their top photographer. And he came back and another time after that he had more pictures. But I wasn't here. But he. You were out of it. I think you might be in the American.

00;03;13;22 - 00;03;19;20
Speaker 5
Because we didn't have any travel cases. I thought you were not married or didn't care.

00;03;19;23 - 00;03;24;04
Speaker 4
Were you on this side or that side of the.

00;03;24;07 - 00;03;25;25
Speaker 2
I would agree.

00;03;25;27 - 00;03;28;11

Speaker 5
I came down a little.

00;04;05;19 - 00;04;07;25

00;17;40;17 - 00;17;50;10
Unknown
On looking at that. Yeah. yeah.

00;17;50;12 - 00;17;54;13
Speaker 2
We got a survey here.

00;17;54;15 - 00;17;57;10
Speaker 5
And years.

00;17;57;10 - 00;18;02;28
Speaker 2
Ago. Yeah, yeah, we're getting old. Can't find the old. We get to go and.

00;18;03;00 - 00;18;07;27
Speaker 4
We talked with Earl, and he mentioned that that they come down and survey all the corners.

00;18;07;28 - 00;18;09;16
Speaker 5
Earmarked. Yes. Yeah.

00;18;09;18 - 00;18;44;18
Speaker 2
You know, this is a special crew, and that's all they do. Get. We run the boundary lines where the markers are and the witness created or practically go on and no marker, just little pile of stone. And under each pile of stone, if you hit right on the pavement big. Well, if I'm back there and in the back now I want to look on.

00;18;44;21 - 00;19;07;29
Speaker 2
And that was right up here and our figures, the way we read it and the way we run it out, part of it here, right. We're on the trail. Yeah, There they description was a little bit blurry and we put a magnifying glass on it and no way we interpret it the way they interpret a little bit different.

00;19;08;01 - 00;19;29;24
Speaker 2
And I'm sure they did. They with our interpretation. God, I knew where it was when I put that right up there with it. Right wear on it there. But there are probably a couple of people they going up to the right part of it, but not brown. Yeah, that's just in right up here.

00;19;29;26 - 00;19;35;04
Speaker 3
That's real interesting. Some of the things you find in those old tobacco cans too, like.

00;19;35;06 - 00;20;06;01
Speaker 2
Well, we got lucky about the beginnings over there, right up there on the bluff. And the legend is on a bluff here. And so far, good Governor. Number one. second. Don't know where I can go and so on, on your way. And. And we've got there and we we get it right on the right on the money.

00;20;06;04 - 00;20;20;15
Speaker 2
But you see, that is the part of the monument there. I they, when they put it in. Not sure but actually the rocks coming down through there and so on and what that all.

00;20;20;17 - 00;20;27;19
Speaker 4
What did they chisel any of the rock with. Rock chisel. I mean something or other.

00;20;27;26 - 00;20;29;29
Speaker 5
Or whatever is painted on it.

00;20;30;01 - 00;20;33;26
Speaker 4
And I mean but the original they weren't rock chisel on the original.

00;20;34;05 - 00;20;50;24
Speaker 2
yeah. they come up near a kid right into a good big fat rock, but not many of the they cornered on it right.

00;20;50;26 - 00;20;56;11
Speaker 3
Where did they go? I mean, so when you when you bought the place.

00;20;57;04 - 00;21;23;20
Speaker 2
they're right here. But you frame that right here and then you went up the creek on a trip A and that was started in the neighborhood too early and I didn't want to be in go living in that little house there and for a long time I wouldn't I couldn't find it hard. Well, I know where it passes for but that I you just put him up that way.

00;21;23;20 - 00;21;47;02
Speaker 2
You know, the keep him from going in that that when it got even 93 years ago when you get one and I didn't take care of himself and get around but they come in and get them so I had them so I packed them up in there with their bring right it on, you know, we'll get it right here.

00;21;47;04 - 00;22;21;04
Speaker 2
They already know one go off and it'll come up a little bit and then they'll drop back down and that's when it's daylight. But bring them up and know you want around, right. If you're not gonna be down here in another Great. And when you left that now that little thing that in front of mind if I don't come back and everything at your and if it wasn't in the cabin I forget where it was but it was someplace outside the camp.

00;22;21;07 - 00;22;46;03
Speaker 2
And so you get he got one on the way up the great change conditioning and everything you got going on in the morning, take him out and then they could take water until that little tramp at the bottom got that had all the paper going away back.

00;22;46;06 - 00;22;48;25
Unknown
Do you still have them? yeah.

00;22;48;27 - 00;23;04;20
Speaker 2
I'm just waiting kind of over University one they take care of. Yeah, on those, right. They don't go to them growing where they stay right here and, and okay.

00;23;04;22 - 00;23;08;27
Speaker 4
What, where did he come from?

00;23;08;29 - 00;23;17;22
Speaker 2
Well, I don't know. Either he was born in this country or not. But, you know, the welfare.

00;23;17;24 - 00;23;20;04
Speaker 3
Mostly trapping early.

00;23;20;06 - 00;23;28;25
Speaker 2
In he was of small stature. He was probably five, seven.

00;23;28;28 - 00;23;36;07
Unknown
And about 135 and.

00;23;36;09 - 00;23;42;03
Speaker 2
But one thing that he really had a sharp eye he could figure out back in the ninth grade.

00;23;42;05 - 00;23;46;19
Unknown
Right here you.

00;23;46;19 - 00;23;50;24
Speaker 5
Town how he came into the country.

00;23;50;26 - 00;23;54;09
Speaker 2
Well, do you want to know your poor brown?

00;23;54;14 - 00;23;55;26
Speaker 4
Yeah, I.

00;23;55;29 - 00;24;33;16
Speaker 2
Well, he was a Civil War veteran and he told me, you see, he was very hard of hearing. But I come down there of evenings and you sit down and he can't talk. And that's the way I. I gathered up all of it and he said that he was in the trenches before Vicksburg to see the Vicksburg with Wild Bill Hickok and the that the there were no it get one legend and Wild Bill Hickok that really showed you with a pit bull arrival.

00;24;33;16 - 00;25;00;13
Speaker 2
It didn't make any difference which one and they told me that well and from there I don't know about the Spanish-American War, but I think he was in that too. But I, I couldn't be positive on that. But then he was in the Indian War and the battle, the Little Bighorn, when they massacred the whole Custer outfit. Why?

00;25;00;13 - 00;25;40;02
Speaker 2
The only reason he was alive. He was a scout with Indian. And they came in, of course, to get after the Indians. That and left. And there wasn't very good looking side. But he said there's one thing that the Indian didn't do. They didn't go country and yeah, that beautiful they evidently growing golden hair and then they were then here on the ship captain and he was going in and damnation green and which through to you and they ambushed them right up here.

00;25;40;04 - 00;26;20;14
Speaker 2
If you know where the whole barbwire look you can still see over the all the I'm of it cross banquet grub banquet from one bar to the other amidst the blood and the Indians ambushed them up there and the Indians were in the rock waiting for them again. By the time they got in the middle of the creek, some of them and some of them out on the bank, why they opened up on the Indian, that gun, you know, do that and said that they the guns were all black powder, of course, and pretty little timbered bottom there and the the pit there we found it and then somebody come along, discovered it, wrecked it,

00;26;20;14 - 00;26;52;24
Speaker 2
dug it all out, looking for stuff there. And the part nervous was kind of temple thing, you know, and how they see it. But evidently somebody trained in that sort of situation. And anyhow that they they wanted to get a hold of your dad and but smoke got to take them they couldn't see each other so the Indian it up and they sat and looked at him when the fireworks started that I held back that little bit.

00;26;52;27 - 00;27;01;09
Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah. Man. Eating them out and then expanded out to try to get them up.

00;27;01;09 - 00;27;02;19
Speaker 3
Come down the bottom, the creek.

00;27;02;21 - 00;27;32;12
Speaker 2
Down on the bridge where they'd have a gap while they get out there and they retreated back up on the burning trail and where they the two crippled And as they one little overnight there they they didn't pick up any water dig up there. Well I've gone to the grave but Corbin and right after you know and and anyhow they got up on Vinegar Hill.

00;27;32;12 - 00;27;38;29
Speaker 2
Well I had some vinegar so they drank that and that's where Vinegar Hill got back.

00;27;39;02 - 00;27;42;04
Unknown
And that's why we got too much vinegar. And again.

00;27;42;06 - 00;28;03;17
Speaker 2
And that's where they've got the idea that country and then Utah this country and then he came here and they live here off and on and then he'd be over South Park or over on the main dam and bend over and then he'd, but they all had drifted back here and they finally Byler homestead on it. Yeah.

00;28;03;23 - 00;28;06;03
Speaker 2
That, that in 1927.

00;28;06;05 - 00;28;09;02
Speaker 4
But when did you know when he first came here.

00;28;09;05 - 00;28;14;13
Speaker 2
Well, the 1879 out of the, the campaign of the campaign.

00;28;14;15 - 00;28;19;08
Speaker 4
But then when he first, you know, this spot started parties, I.

00;28;19;10 - 00;28;23;14
Speaker 2
Don't know that I've ever been out of not out of thin air, that he was probably like I.

00;28;23;14 - 00;28;25;11
Speaker 5
Would go.

00;28;25;14 - 00;28;49;10
Speaker 2
Yeah, you know, they'd go quick down here for a while. And they old if you look down here, you can see they'll be the old cabin. It burned down but you can see where he had a stone fireplace near the left, the trail just this side of the creek. I've never been down there and, well, you know, it's probably 50 feet back this way in the creek and maybe all that far off of the trail.

00;28;49;13 - 00;29;11;27
Speaker 2
And you can be up there, you know, pretty well growing over that. You can make it out. And then he he finally came up here and the old original cabin here was over. That used to be a cellar there where it all filled with crash and stuff. Now, there and there was a building over that. But while there, it burned down here.

00;29;11;29 - 00;29;13;10
Speaker 2
And we've got pictures of that.

00;29;13;10 - 00;29;17;25
Speaker 4
I think somewhere near that, along with some of the hides, the coyotes on it.

00;29;17;27 - 00;29;39;27
Speaker 5
No, no, no. That was the cabin was there. And, I think we have those pictures in town. I put them in the we had made pictures and and also put it back out so thermal. And so they when we got all they didn't.

00;29;40;00 - 00;29;45;17
Speaker 2
Show children, they set up this monument or Soldier bar over private eighth.

00;29;45;17 - 00;29;46;29
Speaker 3
Grade.

00;29;47;01 - 00;30;26;14
Speaker 2
And we've got the we, we've got all of that either in writing or in picture. I got the old original map of it printed very here that was drawn by a lieutenant, and this part of it came in here too. So they, it, they made it, I think, a two, three, three print in here. By the time I got sheet beaten over here on the end of that boot creek, it had the battle bar and, and they split out of there.

00;30;26;14 - 00;30;51;24
Speaker 2
But this, this data is all on that map. That's an everyday skirmish here. soldier, your bar here, and it's, it's all written out very fine, but nice handwriting on that map. There's a whole history of your campaign blueprints. Yeah. And then we've got a little tiny, old original.

00;30;52;06 - 00;30;52;25
Speaker 4
you did?

00;30;52;27 - 00;31;06;22
Speaker 2
Yeah. And, so what if they. The data that matches the accurate, That's all we're doing. Exactly.

00;31;06;25 - 00;31;14;00
Speaker 2
But the whole history of the Jupiter campaign is on that map.

00;31;14;02 - 00;31;22;02
Speaker 3
Sounds like you got a lot of resources. A person could use them. All right, I got an interpretive program for the.

00;31;22;04 - 00;31;48;15
Speaker 2
Yeah, And then he was Cougar, a student on one of his Cougar Day, and they were the same year. And he told me at one time the state already and $800 in bounty. Well, I kept the cougar in check in here. It wasn't really the central land because we had thousands of deer. But in the early days now it should be your campaign.

00;31;48;18 - 00;32;16;13
Speaker 2
You heard all mountain shaking. You. not true. And that's what the sheet beaters practically lived on. And and that's where they it his name Brian. But you know, in the 1880s where we had that disease it went through the the sheep not here but everywhere and practically wiped the sheep herd down clear around the corner and now they made a pretty good comeback.

00;32;16;15 - 00;32;23;14
Speaker 2
But at one time the sheep was a very low population in here.

00;32;23;17 - 00;32;24;28
Speaker 4
Was that longhorn?

00;32;25;01 - 00;33;14;21
Speaker 2
Yeah. Well, look at the same sheep. Yeah, we got it. My notebook, The declarative, primitive area where I know that people are allowed within the boundary. But if you imagine that the these places that were in here should remain in here and that they act strange or a part of the, of the deal and so on, that, that more than maybe we have the memory of that name and then they are however the best made to administer the prairie very, very to the state mine.

00;33;14;23 - 00;33;21;02
Speaker 3
What was the first settlement on the creek, The first homestead, You know that.

00;33;21;04 - 00;33;31;06
Speaker 2
Where I imagine that there was Homestead earlier than a couple of days. Perry lived here for quite a while before he filed.

00;33;31;08 - 00;33;39;14
Speaker 5
That remainder of the on his told us that this was occupied by the Globe Brothers.

00;33;39;16 - 00;33;52;16
Speaker 2
And that had been 1903. That was the time of the end of the do in mind of your thunder Mom Thunder Mountain days.

00;33;52;18 - 00;33;55;06
Speaker 3
Both brothers are actually on this side.

00;33;55;08 - 00;34;06;16
Speaker 5
That's what he told us and that Dave lived down at no country. Then when they left this that he came up here.

00;34;06;18 - 00;34;45;22
Speaker 2
But Dave was here in in 1903 because, this built him, gave us all that information. What they would do. See, there was no higher speed up the Thunder Mountain. Well, you probably don't know or know what it looked like up there trying to place right out of monumental air. And so they would come down here, bring the ice cream, or probably two or three of them and killed or were made it was they were down near them and they got up there and then they bring their ice cream back down here during the winter.

00;34;45;24 - 00;34;52;02
Speaker 2
And that was the, over the situation.

00;34;52;04 - 00;34;54;24
Speaker 3
But, and the other.

00;34;54;27 - 00;34;56;10
Speaker 5
Cabin crew and.

00;34;56;12 - 00;35;02;06
Speaker 3
Some of the others that along the way, one way those that, you know.

00;35;02;09 - 00;35;04;29
Speaker 5
I have any idea, I don't know.

00;35;05;02 - 00;35;12;14
Speaker 2
But you did it all then of the same time of the brothers who are here, not the unremarked they.

00;35;14;27 - 00;35;19;22
Speaker 5
the Cabin Creek was occupied by. People were never going here.

00;35;19;25 - 00;35;20;19
Speaker 2
No, no.

00;35;20;19 - 00;35;26;28
Speaker 5
And around what was the man's name.

00;35;27;01 - 00;35;30;25
Speaker 4
Wasn't behind Bell Heimer, You know, no.

00;35;30;28 - 00;35;33;20
Speaker 2
Matter who you were, was were on the.

00;35;33;22 - 00;35;53;27
Speaker 4
Mountain, you know, in Jack Wenzel. No, at Dixie. They were down the mountain for a mile. And they've got.

00;35;53;29 - 00;35;56;06
Speaker 5
That tree that's born.

00;35;56;08 - 00;36;03;26
Speaker 2
When we got right back to camp, I.

00;36;03;29 - 00;36;17;17
Speaker 5
You know, I've never been here all the time. I've done a lot of grocery shopping over there, know the just far away 65 miles.

00;36;17;19 - 00;36;25;23
Speaker 3
To find someone out there trying to figure out yesterday who you might get and have just done to me. She's got a smile. Just like Judy.

00;36;25;24 - 00;36;29;05
Speaker 4
People and eyes. You know.

00;36;29;06 - 00;36;32;06
Speaker 5
I don't know if you've met people. Yes. You was here, you know.

00;36;32;07 - 00;36;36;12
Speaker 4
That's right. And I just know it. You talk the same.

00;36;36;13 - 00;36;39;29
Speaker 3
Security that I do. It. Is this the thing.

00;36;39;29 - 00;36;41;01
Speaker 5
That makes you real.

00;36;41;01 - 00;36;42;27
Speaker 3
People? That she's a darling person.

00;36;43;03 - 00;36;44;27
Speaker 2
Of the country?

00;36;45;22 - 00;37;06;14
Speaker 5
no. Who is the man who is going by the world?

00;37;06;16 - 00;37;07;03
Unknown
I don't know.

00;37;07;03 - 00;37;20;29
Speaker 2
The one that man up there. And they were one of the bones that came the and I.

00;37;21;01 - 00;37;24;10
Speaker 3
Had the gory side.

00;37;24;12 - 00;37;26;12
Speaker 5
Right.

00;37;26;14 - 00;37;57;03
Speaker 2
Way to tramp around this ranch came about. They blew up that three administrators and. That's why they out either the active one that or the woman that original work but one and so we drew up an agreement when I was in there in the spring and I gave Dave $500 that you want to 1200 dollars for this place.

00;37;57;06 - 00;38;29;08
Speaker 2
And now, the the commitment all by get your get there met your administrator in year one up and with the proper papers and I'll give you the money will complete the deal in November and I was the one of them at a ranch over there and so this while each camp came down they had the papers and we got everything all mixed up, legal.

00;38;29;08 - 00;39;20;17
Speaker 2
And he'd had a feud up here with the proper name. While that or what. No, no, bear nowhere. And he was littering up here in what they call low bear base. And now it's the first ring on right up here, above here. But, well, now, up the creek near that panther. Well, we got this all fixed up and while they had these papers in his back and he took out of the creek and he got up there and I guess, I don't know, was that argument or not?

00;39;20;17 - 00;39;24;13
Speaker 2
But when he turned to go, we've been talking with Loba over our shot in the back of the head, the.

00;39;24;13 - 00;39;27;09
Speaker 4
3030.

00;39;27;11 - 00;40;14;25
Speaker 2
And that clip that kind of stopped the transfer. The papers right there, you know. Right. And this low bar came down here, just walked the other day, the cabin down there. And matter of fact that I just a low bar or I did believe that. And so we had telephones all over the country then called they got word to the sheriff and and gave and in due time they came in and out the body and I, I called the sheriff and said, would you please regard those papers when you open the steps back and forth with the army and that I know him and he was acquainted with me and he said, Yeah, I would

00;40;14;25 - 00;40;20;12
Speaker 2
do that. You know, that's the way that they do it. Place where we.

00;40;20;13 - 00;40;23;27
Speaker 4
Carter what happened the low where.

00;40;24;00 - 00;40;31;21
Speaker 2
They put him in and.

00;40;31;24 - 00;40;35;16
Speaker 3
Find out why they did.

00;40;35;19 - 00;40;38;07
Speaker 4
Did they ever find out why he shot him?

00;40;38;19 - 00;40;55;20
Speaker 2
well, they've been a little couple. I think maybe they stepped on a little tiny little barbed wire or something along those lines, you know.

00;40;55;22 - 00;40;56;28
Speaker 4
And I get get go.

00;40;57;00 - 00;41;03;17
Speaker 5
But nothing happened, you know, And like, it's the same.

00;41;03;20 - 00;41;09;13
Speaker 4
Yeah. And then they can their.

00;41;09;15 - 00;41;14;11
Speaker 5
Except now you just don't hear me.

00;41;14;13 - 00;41;15;03
Speaker 2
I know. Yes.

00;41;15;03 - 00;41;16;24
Speaker 3
Not quite as quickly.

00;41;16;27 - 00;41;27;07
Speaker 2
And then you want to stand up a little farther. You're why I was building homes up in both in. don't put that. yeah.

00;41;27;09 - 00;41;28;04
Speaker 3
I think it.

00;41;28;06 - 00;41;42;14
Speaker 4
Well before we hit that when you came in here now you said you had a ranch or in a prison, right? Yeah. You know, what was it about this country, you know, or this area that.

00;41;42;16 - 00;42;15;26
Speaker 2
Well, I've been in here the fall before. honey, The part came in the back. I was hanging from a dope. I wasn't guiding anybody. And when we when we came in from Samurai on Fort Sam River played very far and down through the Yellowjacket and down Camas Creek, down the middle park, now through here, headed for Chamberlain base.

00;42;15;26 - 00;42;41;17
Speaker 2
And then we had going for the Salmon River over there and out the other way you had swing or you didn't, you didn't, you didn't forum. But there's no boat that you could use to transport your transport your gear across and through anywhere along your. I heard these hounds barking over here and I never paid much attention to it but and I got think about it.

00;42;41;20 - 00;43;13;00
Speaker 2
And one thing that interests me about the time BLM started well labored, it didn't look good to me because it looked to me like the little fellow was on the way out. I had bandages and that he had a gal getting pretty good start and quite a few hawks. And so I decided it was about deep enough and then the next spring I came in here with a saddle or.

00;43;13;07 - 00;43;56;22
Speaker 2
Yeah, so that and thank you. I came up Morgan Creek over 11 feet of snow, literally. I pulled right up on the other side. and stayed with a ranger there. And then I went over the next morning while the folks in Great. Yeah. And, and I, I can't recall where they moved around a little bit and ask you on fell place and that Yes you did and I said well what do you want for that 1200 dollar And so I said okay I gave him for 500, I said, I'll be back in this fall.

00;43;56;24 - 00;44;15;09
Speaker 2
And then we went ahead with the deal. And that's what I come to buy. And it wasn't a bad deal, know, I never done anything with it until later or 48 or nine, but I kept it all.

00;44;15;09 - 00;44;16;00
Speaker 3
Those years and it was.

00;44;16;00 - 00;44;22;04
Speaker 2
Always somebody here staying here, the caretaker, so on.

00;44;22;07 - 00;44;27;07
Speaker 5
Whiskey here.

00;44;27;09 - 00;44;32;00
Speaker 4
Where they pack their coin, you.

00;44;32;02 - 00;44;39;19
Speaker 5
Know, anything like that or know that they can give it there.

00;44;39;22 - 00;44;49;10
Speaker 4
Now was that in what time span was that when they know little brother here.

00;44;49;12 - 00;45;16;27
Speaker 2
Well it was in the fall of it was in the fall of 33 that I was in here hunting in the spring of 34 that I came in and talked to Dave about buying the place. And then that fall of 35, why the table was completed.

00;45;17;00 - 00;45;23;28
Speaker 4
That was when low bar of a shot fallen 35. Now the whiskey making, was.

00;45;24;01 - 00;45;32;06
Speaker 5
That the thing? I was in the picture then? Now I don't know. But you know, it was when you told me when Tex Martin was here.

00;45;32;08 - 00;45;56;04
Speaker 2
Yeah. Tex Martin would that year. And that he was probably a pretty high grade bootlegger, and they'd make the whiskey in here. I could see the factory could come in with a load of sugar and water they made to make this whiskey. And basically old still up here in the garage. And when we cleaned the creek out, we got 750 gallon barrel down.

00;45;56;06 - 00;46;14;08
Speaker 2
You know, they, they had gone to go and then they laid back the whiskey up and then the little barrels, you know, and one on each side of the pack on and go out and the evidently the shaking all the time they got out Right. You know.

00;46;14;10 - 00;46;15;05
Speaker 5
Yeah.

00;46;15;08 - 00;46;17;11
Speaker 2
But anyhow they got.

00;46;17;13 - 00;46;17;28
Speaker 5
Here.

00;46;18;00 - 00;46;47;27
Speaker 2
And it's snowstorm a little bit later on profile and they had the had to take the whiskey out and hit the snow and somebody sent the pack or they had man on that end of it. That was better than that. The snow was going off up there and then barrel again. they had to go up and salvage it Could be in pretty good shape then, you know.

00;46;47;29 - 00;46;53;20
Speaker 2
But anyhow, that was good whiskey and had it during bootleg days and that would Yeah, I guess get your stuff and boys.

00;46;53;20 - 00;46;55;12
Speaker 3
One of the guys that was caretaking.

00;46;55;12 - 00;47;14;17
Speaker 2
For you. Yeah. But anyhow I think quite a lot of was concerned right here on the evidently got a little too much consumption of the product up here and they let the fire get away from the.

00;47;14;19 - 00;47;16;09
Speaker 3
Rock.

00;47;16;12 - 00;47;27;28
Speaker 2
They called the Foreign Service out at the end of the fire going down there and they thought that one good. So they go right back and we got our under control, the telephone and you.

00;47;28;00 - 00;47;28;12
Speaker 4
The.

00;47;28;14 - 00;47;42;03
Speaker 2
Clarity of any word anywhere by relaying a bigger get guard we get Doc 130 and but that is that was going to be quite a deal.

00;47;42;05 - 00;47;47;29
Speaker 3
Overt now we're at well part of the brush up here is the still base.

00;47;48;01 - 00;47;53;15
Speaker 2
Just above your cabin right there in the.

00;47;53;18 - 00;47;55;27
Speaker 3
AM. I have to get out and walk around.

00;47;56;00 - 00;47;57;27
Speaker 2
I don't think anybody saw down.

00;47;58;00 - 00;48;01;09
Speaker 5
Well, it may have been in that original cougar camp.

00;48;01;12 - 00;48;05;03
Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah. The wildlife probably that night that.

00;48;05;06 - 00;48;10;02
Speaker 5
The original cougar that was back of the old farmhouse.

00;48;10;04 - 00;48;16;29
Speaker 2
Yeah. I didn't blow that.

00;48;17;01 - 00;48;43;29
Speaker 4
We had a similar instance over in the shell way. There was a fellow named Gal Shear who made a pretty good bird, you know, hit back it out of either the Elk City or the Derby, depending upon the snow is now a real bad in the Bitterroot. So I then had go to hitting with yeah, that I take one of the fellows that had a homestead down below him about 15.

00;48;43;29 - 00;48;46;06
Speaker 2
Miles and.

00;48;46;09 - 00;48;57;21
Speaker 4
Used to pack and feel you talk about and you know you go and you bring in the crack corn and sugar. I'm wondering if you went on the back trip here.

00;48;57;21 - 00;48;58;01
Speaker 5
Yeah.

00;48;58;08 - 00;49;02;11
Speaker 4
Back there by they'd go out with stuff.

00;49;02;13 - 00;49;05;18
Speaker 2
Well, that's the way they work in here.

00;49;05;20 - 00;49;43;14
Speaker 4
Where there are many of the that you know of, of the either original or the second owners of some of these homesteads that were married because there were only 17 homesteads over in this country. There were only two that were married. They were all single men, you know. And when you read all Pettibone Diary in 1913, 14, 15, you know, that all come together at Christmas, you know, and then you have a big, big Christmas feed, you know, surprising those fellows who really put up the food, you know?

00;49;43;16 - 00;49;44;24
Speaker 4
Well.

00;49;44;26 - 00;49;52;15
Speaker 2
I'm sure I had occasion to do, That is the. The original homestead.

00;49;52;16 - 00;49;53;14
Speaker 4
Yeah.

00;49;53;16 - 00;50;10;11
Speaker 2
Or that they changed hands. Why? There was a woman next, and there's Bellingham next in a portion of the Cabin Creek up here and the Missoula. And Blackie wasn't even ranger in here for a good many years. They owned the back. And then there it was. It was.

00;50;10;17 - 00;50;11;01
Speaker 5
Like, you.

00;50;11;01 - 00;50;11;27
Speaker 2
Know.

00;50;11;29 - 00;50;12;21
Speaker 5
That was like.

00;50;12;21 - 00;50;15;17
Speaker 2
Yeah, that wasn't back in the.

00;50;15;19 - 00;50;18;19
Speaker 4
In they had been around in the thirties or so.

00;50;18;22 - 00;50;44;10
Speaker 2
Yeah. however Blackie did part of Homestead to take up a block of country right between the two bombings up there, but that is at a later date and really didn't amount to particularly not to hear that anyone.

00;50;44;12 - 00;50;46;28
Speaker 5
Enjoyed talking to would be members of.

00;50;46;28 - 00;50;49;21

Our court where she lived.

00;50;49;24 - 00;51;29;09

00;51;29;12 - 00;51;42;05
Speaker 4

Speaker 4
Now, she was a cabin crew. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I interrupted you earlier. when I asked you about, you know, how you became interested in this area when you came over from the samurai, and then you started to say something about, Boise. So your wife didn't want you to take.

00;53;36;11 - 00;53;40;18
Speaker 5
I mean, how we met new material?

00;53;40;18 - 00;53;46;10
Unknown
I don't know. Part of it. Well, I don't know.

00;53;46;10 - 00;54;06;06
Speaker 2
Whether the material or not between to that. All right. barely. The now and I was only 15 years old when I started Project.

00;54;06;08 - 00;54;27;16
Speaker 4
Now, you, were in the contracting business there in Boise at that time? yeah well, from the time you quit ranching, had you been in building before when you were ranching or before you're ranching? Yeah.

00;54;27;18 - 00;54;53;17
Speaker 2
I went out of here in 35, and that winter I went up the mountain there in Bata and got a job. But, I had a Denver framer out there. That's when I had calculated that pride, not mine, were going full back and they were right on the apex of this big deposit of copper and a lot of rhetoric.

00;54;53;20 - 00;55;18;24
Speaker 2
They never even smell it. They get blown up and ship it out. And I was out there for nine months and then the mining deal started blowing down. They've got the better copper out of there. And then I came back my and that guard who worked for a contractor there, I decided I want to be a carpenter. I'm already a dump ship carpenter.

00;55;18;26 - 00;55;31;16
Speaker 2
A certain apprenticeship shipped from the shipyard in Army during World War One. And that's where I learned to you that narrow wooden ship and.

00;55;31;18 - 00;55;33;15

Speaker 5
000.

00;55;36;04 - 00;56;02;15
Speaker 2
And so that's where I got in the background there. And then I work for this, contractor in there. I and two more by it. And my contract is the, is gonna work on each out and then things flow metal and people ask me to build homes for them. So I decided, well, I know home for him and I was getting very good.

00;56;02;15 - 00;56;26;25
Speaker 2
But I am the cause is the I won't settle for anything less than perfection. That's always been my, my deal. And she, she accused me of being perfection taken at one time, and she got mad and said, Well, honey, that's the kind of thing you ever said. Yeah, but.

00;56;26;28 - 00;56;33;28
Speaker 5
I mean, you know, there are.

00;56;34;00 - 00;57;04;00
Speaker 2
That. Anyhow, I went the building out and I built right up to the time of the war in 1942. I went to war and gone through year and I was on Eichmann part of the time and around. Levick Yeah, right. They rebuilt that gap, the big airport up there to hear much about. I know got.

00;57;04;03 - 00;57;05;05
Speaker 5
And.

00;57;05;07 - 00;57;39;25
Speaker 2
Yeah, then my when I came home I, I started doing it get no problem I lost contacts. but it was the I wasn't taken to the, the pressure. So I had this place, I had all these here, and I even got offered one to buy it when I was on. Either they even got an offer from the doctor up there, and, so I decided to build this one house on the lot and round up everything.

00;57;39;25 - 00;58;16;01
Speaker 2
I hadn't put a real nice home on it, and I couldn't come in here and cheaper than the real estate business and came by and left the house and, that's right. That's all I remember. And so she didn't know how I finally. And I told her what I was gonna do and that. Well, don't you want to cook?

00;58;16;01 - 00;58;21;04
Speaker 2
Well, that was pretty plain. In order to either put up or run one or to do.

00;58;21;06 - 00;58;25;17
Speaker 5
You know, Right. I don't care about anybody. Zero.
