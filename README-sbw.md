The Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness History Project

The base of this collection was migrated from CONTENTdm.
In CDM it had little metadata and no interpretive content, as it was being used primarily to hold media for the main digital scholarship project site:

https://sbw.lib.uidaho.edu/

The project site is unmaintained and partly broken, with the project wrapping up 2011-2014.
It also included a podcast section "Wilderness Voices" (2011-2013), at:

https://selwaybitterrootproject.wordpress.com/

This collection pulls together all the media assets used by the original site to ensure they remain accessible.

It was updated in 2025 to more clearly explain the context and relationship to the original project.
