## Central Thematic Question

**"What is significance for you of the interplay between the particular/diverse/unique and the shared/universal/ubiquitous?"**

Each of the following University of Idaho community members offered his or her own response to the thematic question. While open to all academic approaches and disciplines, an emphasis was placed on a humanities perspective for the interpretation and understanding of these responses.

The faculty and student responses were conveyed through a series of presentations - a blend of talks, exhibitions and performances, including lectures, readings, art exhibits, dance, musical and theatrical events, as well as reflective discussions. All presentations were held during the Fall and Spring semesters, 2011-12.
