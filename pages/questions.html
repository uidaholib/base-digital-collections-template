<h1>A Humanities Exploration - Initial
Questions</h1>

<p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Application
    of a Metaphor:</b>&nbsp; Can the metaphor and lessons from Yellowtail's Wagon Wheel, in
how Tom and Susie have successfully negotiated the many spokes yet acknowledged
the shared hub and rim, be extended and applied to our entire society and
to the ways we have engaged and expressed the humanities? In
what ways is the "Turning of the Wagon Wheel" applicable to our own lives?&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Are there other metaphors or ways of thinking and doing, besides that of
    Yelllowtail's, that can also facilitate the interplay between our human
    diversity and shared humanity?&nbsp;</li>
  <p><li>
    <b>Diversity
    and Universality in the Humanities:&nbsp;</b>  And more generally, how have we in the humanities gone about understanding, appreciating, communicating,
celebrating and on occasion challenging our rich human diversity (the many
    spokes in all their meanings), as well as our shared humanity (the common hub and
    rim in all their meanings)?&nbsp; In what ways do we in the humanities disciplines express our human
diversity as well as our shared humanity?</li>
  <p><li>
    <b>The
    Dynamic Interplay between Diversity and Universality in the Humanities:
    </b>  How has the humanities informed the interplay and dynamic
relationship between human diversity and shared humanity, between both these
ways of knowing, experiencing and creating the world?&nbsp;&nbsp; How
do we know one from the other?&nbsp; How
are the individual spokes imbued with hub and rim, and the hub and rim infused
with spoke?&nbsp;&nbsp; What might the spokes and hub have in common?
  </li><p>
  <li>
    <b>A
    spin-off question: Social Diversity and Commonality, Stability and Conflict.&nbsp; </b>How do we best maintain the balance of the turning wheel - the
dynamic stasis in our personal lives and throughout our local and world
    communities - given all its varied social categories of gender,
            race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientations, age, class, able-bodiedness?&nbsp;&nbsp;
    How do we best
maintain the balance of the wheel and equality of the spokes if our focus is only on "my spoke," oblivious or even
dismissive of other spokes?&nbsp; How
do we best maintain the balance and equality if we are oblivious or even dismissive of a
shared hub/rim that firmly secures the spokes of the turning wheel?&nbsp; How do we best maintain the balance
    and equality when some spokes are periodically
threatened and weakened, while the fit of the hub and rim loosened?&nbsp;&nbsp;Are
    there any lessons form the Wagon Wheel that might apply to the interplay
    between social diversity and commonality, and to the stability or conflict
    in our lives?

</li>
<p> <li>
    <b>A
    spin-off question: Disciplinarity and Interdisciplinarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>How
    have we in the academy gone about engaging in cross and interdisciplinary
    scholarship, performance and teaching in the face of intransigent disciplinarity?&nbsp;
    How can colleagues from distinct disciplines attempt to collaborate when
    their disciplines adhere to distinctly differing modes of communication, pedagogy,
    research methodology and criteria of legitimizing that research?&nbsp; How 
	can we reconcile what is often understood as the mutual exclusivity of 
	reductionist vs. systems approaches to knowledge?&nbsp; Are
    there any lessons form the Wagon Wheel that might apply to the interplay
    between disciplinary integrity and interdisciplinarity? <br /><br /></li>
 <li>
    <b>A
    spin-off question: Exclusivity and Inclusively.</b>&nbsp; As
    students and faculty engaging in new ways of communication, knowing and doing, in new
    ways of defining our very identity, do we have to give up what once was in
    order to fully become a new?&nbsp; Does an American Indian student, for
    example, have to give up his or her Tribal identity and ways in order to be
    successful in the ways of the Euro-American academy?&nbsp; Does a professor
    of literature have to give up his or her academic competencies in literature
    in order to be competent as an ethnographer or even social scientist?&nbsp;
    Are there an lessons from the Wagon Wheel that might apply to the interplay
    between inclusively and exclusivity?</li>
    <p>
    <li>
    
    <b>  A
    spin-off question: the Idiosyncratic and Nomothetic</b>.&nbsp; How have we
    in our everyday personal and professional lives reconciled and integrated our richly differentiated,
    idiosyncratic experiences from the search for normality, consistency and the
    nomothetic?&nbsp; How has each, in interaction with the other, contributed
    to acts of imagination, discovery and creativity, as well as structures of
    stability, continuity and stasis?&nbsp; Are there any lessons from the Wagon Wheel
    that might apply to the interplay between the idiosyncratic and nomothetic?
    </li><p>
  <li>
     <b>  A
    spin-off question: the Finite and Infinite/Eternal.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; What is
    our place in the cosmos, reconciling our finite self with the boundless
    infinite, our present self with the timeless eternal?&nbsp; Are there
    lessons from the Wagon Wheel that might help situate our humanity within the
    universe?<br /><br /></li>
  <li>
     <b>A
    spin-off question: Communications Technology.</b>&nbsp; How have our rapidly changing technologies and modes of
communications, such as in the social media, impacted our human diversity as
well as our shared humanity? For example, can the events unfolding throughout the world today be in part
attributed to this new mode of communications, either unleashing some expression
of our common humanity, e.g., desire for sovereignty, or colonizing the spokes
of others with the values of one dominate spoke, e.g., the American Dream, or
perhaps it's the influences of some of each?<br /><br /></li>


<li> 
 <b> A spin-off question: Communication and Collaboration, Tolerance and Respect,
 Creativity and 
 Intellectual Curiosity, and Perennial Wisdom and Tradition.</b>
                What are the implications of the
                  interplay of our human diversity and shared humanity on our
                  capacities for communication and collaboration, for local and
 global community, for tolerance,
                  respect and empathy, for imagination and
                  creativity, for intellectual curiosity and discovery, for perennial
 wisdom and tradition, . . .&nbsp; for what it means to be human?&nbsp;&nbsp;Are
  there lessons from the Wagon Wheel that might help us understand and cultivate
  our communications, tolerance, creativity, intellectual curiosity and
 tradition, to help use understand and cultivate our humanity?<br /><br />

    </li>

  <li>
    <b>The
    Humanities Disciplines.</b>&nbsp; How have the humanities disciplines of anthropology/ethnography,
communication studies, cultural studies (American, Black, International, Latin
    American, Native American, Religious,&nbsp; Women's), languages, literature,
    history, philosophy, and the reflection and theory in creative
writing, the performing arts of music, dance and theatre,
and the visual arts of painting, sculpting and architecture attempted in their
varied ways to grapple with the diversity of the many spokes and the
universality of the shared hub/rim, and the interplay between them, addressing the various questions posed here
as well as other questions?</li><p>
    

    <li>
    <b>The
    Exploration.</b>&nbsp; In our quest to better understand and appreciate the interplay
between our human diversity and shared humanity, this series of talks and
performances, of interactive discussions and experiences thus seeks to equip
each participant of this exploration with the regalia that can facilitate
discovery of his or her own meaning to the spokes and hub/rim, and of the
turning Wagon Wheel.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
will be a humanities exploration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's see what we discover.</li>
