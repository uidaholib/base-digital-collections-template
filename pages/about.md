## About the Collection

The Idaho Historical Maps Collection is a digital collection comprised of 9 historical maps depicting various areas in Idaho and the Pacific Northwest between the years 1863 and 1986. The variety of maps in this collection are a small sample of the maps held in the [University of Idaho Library Cartographic Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/find/maps/). The particular items in this digital collection were scanned and made available online when this was still a fairly new thing to doâ€”the [Idaho Snow Loads](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/idahosnow/) map is popular with architects and engineers and was frequently requested before the interactive version became available. The older regional and industrial maps were digitized for preservation purposes.
