## The Collection 

This digital collection contains digital photos featuring the front images of a large collection of political buttons along with a handful of stickers.  The digital collection was created to increase access to the buttons and stickers.  

The [Political Buttons and Stickers Collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv924702) held by the University of Idaho Special Collections and Archives contains 1,911 buttons. The buttons focus on topics including various political campaigns ranging from presidential campaigns to state government elections, novelty buttons, and buttons used for advertisement purposes. The stickers in the collection include bumper stickers for political campaigns on both the presidential and state levels as well as on topics such as overpopulation and professional football. The buttons in this collection date between the 1890s and 2001. They feature a variety of events beyond the election campaigns themselves, including inauguration ceremonies, conventions, advertisements, the Olympic Games, the University of Idaho, and more. 

These buttons were transferred to the University of Idaho Special Collections and Archives by Markie McBrayer, Assistant Professor of Political Science from the Political Science department in 2025. 

Archivist and Special Collections Librarian Kelley Moulton began working with the buttons in January of 2025. Each button was removed from its individual plastic bag and attached to pieces of foam for better organization.  

## Campaign Buttons in the University of Idaho Collection 

The presidential election of 1896, where Republican William McKinley and Democrat William Jennings Bryan ran against one another, was the first election to feature celluloid, mass produced political buttons. These buttons featured a printed image or words on the front of the button which was then covered with a thin sheet of synthetic plastic-like material. Previously, political ephemera was typically thin tintypes with small photographs dating to the 1850s and, even further back, George Washington's first inauguration in 1789 featured clothing buttons and fasteners with words and images that showed one's support for a candidate.[^1]  

Today's buttons are very similar to those from 1896. They still tend to have metal backs with an image of some kind covered with a thin sheet of plastic. But some parts of the buttons have continued to evolve and change as displayed within this collection. A number of buttons feature holographic or lenticular images where the image changes as the angle at which it is viewed changes; these were popular between 1950 and 1980.

The colors used in the buttons changed dramatically as time progressed. The older buttons tend to display a white background with only a few colors displayed if any as well as being very simplistic in design. Newer buttons contain a larger variety of colors, the buttons from 1997 feature bright purples and yellows in addition to featuring more artistic elements in general.

The size of the buttons has also increased! The buttons in this collection range from being smaller than a quarter to almost as large as a dinner plate.

Most of the buttons are of the standard round shape, but hidden within the collection are rectangular buttons, buttons shaped like hats, buttons that look like sunflowers, numerous elephants, buttons with ribbons, heavily beaded and decorated buttons, and more.

&nbsp;

Campaign buttons have also been used to represent various topics. Slogans were displayed on buttons in the 1896 election ("I will vote for sound money") and have continued to the present. The slogans can range from focusing on specific topics ("Third Liberty Loan") to specific candidates ("Church for Idaho").

&nbsp;

Word play is also a very strong theme in many of the buttons. Candidates often made plays on their names and used symbols to represent part of their name when possible. One of Barry Goldwater's 1964 buttons for example features the chemical symbol for gold (Au) along with the chemical formula for water (H2O) to represent his name on one of his buttons.

Citizens Party candidate Barry Commoner in 1980 used the phrase "Put a Commoner in the White House" as a play on his name.  Others used images with a phrase as part of their campaign. A button from the 1940 election has a round button with "For President Will-" displayed and a key dangling below, a play on Republican Party nominee Wendell Willkie's name.

These campaign buttons also feature more than just the two primary political parties in the United States. Numerous third-party candidates are featured. Ross Perot (Reform Party/Independent), Ralph Nader (Green Party), Joseph Lightburn (Constitution), and many others are represented.

Additionally, the families of candidates are also represented on various buttons. Numerous First Ladies such as Nancy Reagan, Pat Nixon, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Barbara Bush are featured on buttons. In a few more recent buttons, First Family is all featured on the button, as an example, a button from 2000 shows George W., Laura, Barbara, and Jenna Bush.
