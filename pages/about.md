## About the Collection

This digital collection consists of 164 images, 115 documents, and 33 interviews from the [Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness History Project](https://sbw.lib.uidaho.edu/index.html), an NEH funded exploration into the human aspects of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, one of the largest wilderness areas in the United States. 

A majority of these items are housed in the [University of Idaho Special Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/) department and listed in the Sources Related to the History of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area [finding aid](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv16268/).
