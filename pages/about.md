## About the Collection

This digital collection consists of images, documents, and interviews from the [Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness History Project](https://sbw.lib.uidaho.edu/index.html), an NEH funded exploration into the human aspects of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, one of the largest wilderness areas in the United States. 

The Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness History Project ended in 2011, leaving their website unmaintained. 
Although still accessible, the website may have broken features and links.
This collection gathers the project's items together, but does not reproduce all the original features.

A majority of these items are housed in the [University of Idaho Special Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/) department and listed in the Sources Related to the History of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area [finding aid](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv16268/).
