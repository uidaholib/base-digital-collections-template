## About the Collection

*By Brian Tibayan, 2024 Strong Fellow*

The [WWAMI program](https://www.uwmedicine.org/school-of-medicine/md-program/wwami) is a partnership between the University of Washington School of Medicine and the five states of Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI) to provide accessible medical education addressing the need for physicians in the region, particularly in rural areas. 
This collection presents a scrapbook of photos, correspondence, and clippings documenting WWAMI's early years from 1971 to 1975 at University of Idaho, found in the [WWAMI records collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv759233) held at Special Collections and Archives.

Through photographs, letters, newspaper clippings, press releases, and memos, the WWAMI scrapbook documents the history of the medical education program, highlighting its development, implementation, and significant impact from 1971 to 1975. 
The collection underscores key milestones, student experiences, field trips, clinical rotations, and the contributions of faculty and community partners.

The content vividly portrays the program's efforts to address rural healthcare shortages, enhance medical training, and foster inter-institutional collaboration. 
Furthermore, the collection delves into the planning and approval processes, educational curriculum, influence on rural healthcare, community and institutional support, and addresses challenges, criticisms, cultural interactions, diversity, achievements, personal stories, and financial and administrative aspects.

This rich historical perspective helps illustrate the program's transformative role in regional medical education.

**_Please Note:_** the program was called "WAMI" until 1996 when Wyoming joined adding the second "W" to the acronym.
