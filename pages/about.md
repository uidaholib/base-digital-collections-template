## About this collection

This collection contains digitized copies of various photos by Sheldon Zadok Thayer and some correspondence by the Thayer family. 

The photos in the collection were donated by Sheldon Thayer's granddaughter, Jill Holgren. Prompted by community interest, the collection was digitized in 2024. 

The [original documents](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv576502) are held by [University of Idaho Special Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/index.html).

## Historical Note

Sheldon Zadok Thayer was born on July 10, 1902 in Toledo, Oregon. Oreta Vernice (Averil) Thayer was born on April 22, 1905 in Falls City, Oregon. After their marriage, they moved their young family to Hailey, Idaho around 1935. 

The family consisted of Sheldon and Vernice, their son Averill, and their daughters Virginia, Joan, and Janice. It also included Sheldon's mother, Effie Crosno Thayer.

The family later moved to Hagerman, Idaho, where Sheldon worked for Idaho Power and opened a photo studio. He was known for large black and white framed landscapes of Idaho. Some were hand-colored by Vernice and signed S. Z. Thayer. 

Sheldon died on July 22, 1988 and Vernice on December 2, 1998.
