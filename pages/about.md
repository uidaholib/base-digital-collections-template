## The Collection 

The digital collection was created to increase access to an impressive assemblage of buttons and stickers, most of which relate to American political life. Researchers can find photos of the button fronts, and may notice that the print quality and clarity can vary dramatically.  

The [Political Buttons and Stickers Collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv924702) preserved by the University of Idaho Special Collections and Archives contains 1,911 buttons and a few dozen stickers, dating between 1890 and 2001. Many of the buttons convey information about various federal and state political campaigns, while others are more humorous or used for advertisement purposes. They feature a variety of events beyond the election campaigns themselves, including inauguration ceremonies, conventions, advertisements, the Olympic Games, the University of Idaho, and more. The stickers in the collection address political campaigns as well as on topics like overpopulation and professional football. 

These buttons were transferred by faculty in the U of I Politics and Philosophy Department to the University Library in 2025. Archivist and Special Collections Librarian Kelley Moulton began working with the collection in January of 2025. Each button was removed from existing plastic packaging and pinned to archival foam for better organization. Button identification relied on some minimal documentation that accompanied each item at the time of donation, augmented by additional research where possible. Researchers are encouraged to help improve the current descriptions if they notice errors or omissions. 

After the collection of buttons was catalogued, Archives Coordinator Zoe Stave took photographs of the items, experimenting with effective lighting and photo editing. Digital Archivist Rebecca Hastings prepared the photos and metadata for inclusion in this digital collection. This was truly a team effort, from start to finish.


## Campaign Buttons in the University of Idaho Collection 

The presidential election of 1896, in which Republican William McKinley and Democrat William Jennings Bryan ran against one another, was the first contest to incorporate celluloid, mass produced political buttons into campaigning. These buttons featured a printed image or words on the front of the button which was then covered with a thin sheet of synthetic plastic-like material. Political ephemera of earlier generations was typically thin tintypes with small photographs dating to the 1850s. In an even earlier decade, George Washington’s first inauguration in 1789 featured clothing buttons and fasteners with words and images that showed one’s support for a candidate.[^1]  

Today’s buttons are very similar to those from 1896. They still tend to have metal backs with an image of some kind covered with a thin sheet of plastic. But some advances in button technology can be found in this collection. A number of buttons feature holographic or lenticular images where the image changes as the angle at which it is viewed changes; these were popular between 1950 and 1980.

The colors used in the buttons changed dramatically as time progressed. The older buttons generally included a white background with only a few additional colors, making for very simplistic designs. Newer buttons contain a broader spectrum of colors, like the buttons from 1997 with bright purples and yellows, as well as more artistic elements in general.

&nbsp;

The size of the buttons has also increased! The buttons in this collection range from being smaller than a quarter to almost as large as a dinner plate.

&nbsp;

Most of the buttons are round, but hidden within the collection are rectangular buttons, buttons shaped like hats, buttons that look like sunflowers, a variety of elephants, buttons with ribbons, heavily beaded and decorated buttons, and more.

&nbsp;

Political buttons have been used to represent various topics. Adding slogans to buttons began with the 1896 election (“I will vote for sound money”) and has persisted to the present. The slogans can range from focusing on specific topics (“Third Liberty Loan”) to specific candidates (“Church for Idaho”).

&nbsp;

Word play is another common theme among this collection of buttons. Candidates often made plays on their names and used symbols to represent part of their name. One of Barry Goldwater’s 1964 buttons, for example, features the chemical symbol for gold (Au) along with the chemical formula for water (H2O).

Citizens Party candidate Barry Commoner in 1980 used the phrase “Put a Commoner in the White House” as a play on his name. Others used images with a phrase as part of their campaign. A button from the 1940 election has a round button with “For President Will-“ displayed and a key dangling below, a reference to Republican Party nominee Wendell Willkie.

&nbsp;

These campaign buttons also feature more than just two dominant political parties, numerous third-party candidates appear. Ross Perot (Reform Party/Independent), Ralph Nader (Green Party), Joseph Lightburn (Constitution), and many others are represented.

&nbsp;

The families of candidates also often got included on buttons. Numerous First Ladies such as Nancy Reagan, Pat Nixon, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Barbara Bush can be found in the U of I collection. In a few more recent buttons, the First Family is all featured on the button, like a button from 2000 picturing George W., Laura, Barbara, and Jenna Bush.

These are just a few of the elements and themes represented in this collection. Consider what other connections exist as you explore this digital collection of 100+ years of American history.
