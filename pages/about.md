## About the Collection

By Brian Tibayan, 2024 Strong Fellow

The WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, Idaho) collection documents the comprehensive history of the WWAMI medical education program, highlighting its development, implementation, and significant impact from 1971 to 1975. This collaborative effort, involving the University of Idaho and other institutions across five states, is captured through 162 items including photographs, letters, newspaper clippings, press releases, and memos. The collection underscores key milestones, student experiences, field trips, clinical rotations, and the contributions of faculty and community partners. It vividly portrays the program's efforts to address rural healthcare shortages, enhance medical training, and foster inter-institutional collaboration. Furthermore, the collection delves into the planning and approval processes, educational curriculum, influence on rural healthcare, community and institutional support, and addresses challenges, criticisms, cultural interactions, diversity, achievements, personal stories, and financial and administrative aspects. This rich historical perspective illustrates the program's transformative role in regional medical education.
