## About this collection

This collection brings together posters created by students from the University of Idaho College of Engineering as their senior capstone projects. Posters from the Engineering Design EXPO events of 2020-2025 are represented here. In addition, the collection includes program booklets for the EXPO events of 2001, 2002, 2005, 2007, and 2014-2025. 

## About the Engineering Design EXPO

The University of Idaho Engineering Design EXPO has been held annually since 1993, making it the longest-running student engineering and technological innovation exhibition in the Pacific Northwest.

During their senior year, undergraduate students in the U of I College of Engineering work in groups to execute capstone projects, which may focus on a single field of engineering or bring together students from multiple departments in the college. Faculty advisors guide students through their projects, and each project has a sponsor, either an expert from the university or a representative of an outside company or organization. Frequent external sponsors include Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, NASA, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and the Idaho National Laboratory.

In late April or early May each year, students present posters that describe their projects at the Engineering Design EXPO. Various venues on campus have hosted the EXPO, including the Kibbie Dome and the Bruce Pitman Center; in recent years it has taken place in the ICCU Arena. The event is an opportunity for pre-college students and other members of the public to learn about the University of Idaho's Engineering program, and it provides a space in which U of I Engineering students may meet with industry leaders from around the region.

## About CollectionBuilder CSV

This demo collection features items from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/), and is build using [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv).

CollectionBuilder-CSV is a "Stand Alone" template for creating digital collection and exhibit websites using Jekyll, given:

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of images, PDFs, audio, or video files

Driven by your collection metadata, the template generates engaging visualizations to browse and explore your objects.
The resulting static site can be hosted on any basic web server.

[CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/) is an set of open source tools for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.
See [CB Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for detailed information.
