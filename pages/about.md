## About the Collection

Collected by Dennis Baird over several years and many trips to government archives and described by Idaho native Jordan Wrigley, the Archival Idaho Photograph Collection features some of the earliest extant photographs of Idaho, as well as countless other historical gems related to our fine state. Browse the collection to view images of early mining, logging, and agricultural industries in Idaho, landscape photographs of Idaho's iconic public lands, the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) at work, and more.
