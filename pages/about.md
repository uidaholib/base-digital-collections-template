## About Turning of the Wheel

{% include feature/image.html objectid="turning017" width="50" %}

How we conceptualize the interplay between the unique and the universal, between the diverse spokes and common hub/rim of the Wheel has far reaching implications on our capacities for communication and collaboration, for discovery and creativity, for tolerance, respect and empathy, for building and sustaining local and global community.

The relationship of the particular and ubiquitous directly affects the learning, research, creativity and civility among and between the students and faculty of the University of Idaho community, and beyond.

In an era of entrenched, seemingly mutually-exclusive, partisan politics, respecting our differences and finding "common ground" are all the more critical.

To address these intriguing albeit ambitious questions you're invited to take a journey through a series of talks and performances, exhibits and readings, interactive discussions and experiences that occurred throughout the Fall and Spring semesters of 2011-12. Our Humanities Exploration will draw from the university - its students and faculty - to help inform and celebrate the university - its students and faculty - and beyond. Let's see what awaits. I'm honored to be your guide.

Rodney Frey, Distinguished Humanities Professor

## A Digital Collection of Events

{% include feature/image.html objectid="turning099" width="50" %}

With the help of many talented individuals and generous organizations throughout the University, the events that occurred during the 2011-2012 Humanities Colloquium series were videotaped and photographed for future use and preservation in a digital archive. This website is the outcome of that work.

The videos and photos, as well as the slides and papers presented, have been archived and uploaded into the the University of Idaho Library's Digital Collections. The talks, performances, and discussions are linked to the right. They can also be accessed via the dropdown menu at the top of each page, and the entire database can be searched using the search box above. Much of the material used here was appropriated from the series' original website, which can be accessed here.

#### Turning of the Wheel PBS Documentary - Denise Bennett
To help us reflect upon and synthesize the various disparate presentations of this Humanities Exploration, a video was produced based on all the presentations and made available as a "video-on-demand," providing a "summary mosaic" of interwoven themes and insights of the year's events. Denise Bennett (Senior Instructor of Journalism and Mass Media) developed, video recorded interviews, and edited this video documentary. The documentary has appeared on Idaho Public Television in the fall of 2012.

#### Video - UI Video Production Center
All events were video recorded by the Video Production Center and rendered accessible for viewing as "video-on-demand" from this web site, via YouTube.

#### Photography & Web Design - Kristin Carlson Becker
Turning of the Wheel events, presentations, performances and exhibits were photographed, processed, and curated by Kristin Carlson Becker. The colloquium talks given by Bill Smith, Stephen Drown, and Sally Graves Machlis & Delphine Keim-Campbell were photographed by University of Idaho student Amrah Canul. Becker and Canul's images can be seen throughout the website. The website was designed by Kristin Carlson Becker, with the assistance of Devin Becker.

#### Digital Archiving - University of Idaho Library's Digital Initiatives
All videos, images, and documents have been archived by the University of Idaho Library's Digital Initiatives department and uploaded into their online database.
