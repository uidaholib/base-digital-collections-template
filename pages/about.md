## The Collection

This digital collection was developed in recognition of the Kibbie Dome's 50th anniversary in 2025. It presents a selection of images and documents from the archival collections of the University of Idaho Library's Special Collections and Archives, with a special emphasis on the Kibbie Dome's formative era in the mid-1970s. The events and subjects represented in this digital collection reflect the history of the Kibbie Dome and some of its predecessor sports facilities on the University of Idaho campus.

All but a few of these historical images and documents were newly digitized for this collection. This curated selection showcases the Kibbie Dome's half-century history through the lens of the University of Idaho's archival collections, reflecting the rich and serendipitous nature of historical documentation. Each time period is illustrated by different kinds of archival materials that capture the spirit and activities of their respective eras. 

## History of the Kibbie Dome

### Before the Dome

In the fall of 1975, University of Idaho students and Vandal fans walked into the Kibbie ASUI Activity Center for the very first time. The covered stadium was visually striking, with a 400-foot-span barrel dome that crested 12 stories above the ground. The enclosed stadium was a much more comfortable and modern facility than previous visitors had ever enjoyed. 

Athletic activities in Moscow date back to 1893, just months after the University of Idaho opened its doors. University football games, track and field events, and other sports brought together athletes and spectators in whatever open spaces were available, both on campus and in the growing town. An open field between the Administration Building and Memorial Gym, named MacLean Field in honor of the university's third president, James MacLean, was the site of many sports events beginning in the 1920s. 

By the mid-1930s, despite hardships imposed by the Great Depression, the university constructed its first stadium. Neale Stadium, named for University President Mervin G. Neale, was completed in time to host the 1937 football season. It was a horseshoe shaped complex that relied on campus topography to create an earthen semi-circular ring around the athletic fields. Wooden benches could accommodate several hundred fans, though the facility still lacked locker rooms or outdoor lighting. For three decades Vandal fans packed the bleachers of Neale Stadium for football games and track and field events. Harsh Palouse winters and general wear and tear took a toll on Neale Stadium; it was condemned in the summer of 1969 and burned down in November 1969. 

While a new stadium was under construction during the 1969 and 1970 seasons, University of Idaho football home games were played in nearby Pullman, Washington, and other locations. In October 1971, the University of Idaho proudly hosted Idaho State University in the brand new Idaho Stadium. The new facility, built on the former Neale Stadium site, featured concrete bench seating and enclosed luxury boxes for VIPs and press. Perhaps energized by the investment in their program, the Vandal football team won the Big Sky Conference in 1971 with its best record to date.  

### Construction of the Kibbie Dome

Originally, Idaho Stadium was planned as an outdoor venue with a seating capacity of more than 20,000, co-located with a large indoor arena for basketball and cultural events. When financing for that project fell through, campus leadership set its sights on a multipurpose facility that could be constructed on a tight budget.  

The U of I put out a bid for an enclosed stadium, and a small Idaho-based company answered the call. Trus Joist Corporation proposed a design centered on wood micro-lam arches and a steel truss system. Following the completion of the building in 1975, the Kibbie Dome received the Structural Achievement Award from the American Society of Civil Engineers. 

The Kibbie-ASUI Activity Center was named in honor of two critical sources of support for constructing the indoor pavilion. William H. Kibbie, a University of Idaho student in the 1930s, made a $300,000 gift to kickstart fundraising for the activity center, and later donated more funds for the renovation of the Kibbie Dome roof. Support from the Associated Students of the University of Idaho (ASUI) was also critical. Together, students advocated for a multipurpose event space and dedicated significant student fees to the effort. In 2023, local credit union P1FCU pledged support and gained naming rights for the next decade.

The fully enclosed Kibbie Dome opened in 1975. Partners continue to invest in the dome's maintenance and development. Problems with the roof necessitated significant repairs in 1982, the East End Addition was completed in 1982, and life and safety upgrades to the facility were conducted between 2009 and 2011, among other repairs and upgrades over the years.

Today, the P1FCU Kibbie Dome stands as a testament to the perseverance and ingenuity of the University of Idaho community. It has evolved from a novel experiment in indoor sports architecture to an essential part of the university's athletic and cultural life. It is a venue that has seen generations of students and alumni come together to celebrate their community, its athletes, and the institution's achievements. 

### A Home for Athletes...

Athletes of all stripes have found a home in the Kibbie Dome. Vandal football, basketball, and track and field competitors may immediately come to mind, but rodeo riders, youth athletes, and Special Olympians are also part of the arena's history. As a multipurpose activity center, the Kibbie Dome has adapted to accommodate an impressive diversity of athletic events. Spectators, for their part, are always close to the action and protected from whatever inclement weather might come rolling through the Palouse.  

The first football game under the dome pitted U of I against in-state rivals Boise State University on October 11, 1975. By all accounts it was a thrilling game, which ended in a 31-31 tie, the only draw recorded in dome history. Just a few months later, the inaugural basketball game ended in victory for the Vandal men on January 21, 1976. For nearly a decade, basketball in the dome was played on a hard rubber court installed directly on the concrete floor. A second-hand hardwood court purchased in 1984 improved overall conditions for players, though reportedly diminished what was a significant home-court advantage. Basketball players and fans further benefitted from a custom configuration in the form of Cowan Spectrum. News coverage in 2001 described it as a "more intimate setting" than the multi-purpose activity center.  

Vandal track and field, along with tennis, also moved into the Kibbie Dome in 1976. In 2017, soccer games moved into the facility. In addition to official collegiate competitions, the fields, courts, and even stairs of the Kibbie Dome have hosted countless hours of practice for U of I's athletes. Beyond the student body, Idahoans from across the state have broken a sweat under the barrel roof, playing championship high school football games, competing in Special Olympics events, and hitting the indoor track during Relay for Life fundraisers.

### ...And So Much More

Purpose built as a flexible indoor activity center and the largest event space in the city, the Kibbie Dome has been transformed into a concert venue, a sales floor, a ceremonial stage, a memorial site, a polling location, and much more. When alumni or local residents are asked about their most vivid Kibbie Dome memories, responses run the gambit from seeing Kenny Rogers perform to being enchanted by Lipizzaner Stallions to walking across the stage as a Moscow High School graduate. Countless memories have been made in the Kibbie Dome during its first half-century, and countless more lie ahead.  

The U of I has long relied on the Kibbie Dome to enrich student life. Chart-topping musical acts offer hardworking students a chance to let their hair down. The world class Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival offers entertainment and education at once. Impressive marching band showcases are as exciting as the games they complement. Events organized by students, like the Tutxinmepu Powwow, broaden horizons and make space for community. Even as some events have found a new home in the ICCU Arena, which completed planners' original vision for sports facilities a half-century after ground broke on Idaho Stadium, the Kibbie Dome remains a beloved site of campus life.  

Events organized by private groups, like businesses or local organizations, round out the Kibbie Dome calendar and bring fun and unique opportunities to the Palouse. In 1977 Moscow children and kids-at-heart were treated to acrobats, clowns, and exotic animals at the American Continental Circus. Shoppers could peruse carpet samples or inspect the latest models of RVs at semi-annual home and auto shows. For many years, students and residents of western Moscow cast their votes inside the Kibbie Dome, which was an official polling place for Latah County.
