<h1>Implications</h1>


<p>In exploring the characteristics and interplay of our human diversity and shared humanity we will
  be addressing some of the &quot;big questions&quot; posed by the
  humanities.&nbsp;&nbsp; While there are certainly many implications that derive
  from the diversity/universality interplay, as a place to begin our journey
  certain interrelated implications
  will be
  explored through the many activities planned throughout the year.&nbsp; These implications certainly
  play out in our own community, the <a href="university.html"> University of
    Idaho</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For our Humanities Exploration and its implications, we will draw from the university -
  its students and faculty - to help inform the university - its students and
  faculty - and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp; All exhibits, performances, readings
  and lectures will be derived from the creativity, experiences and expertise of
  the students and faculty of the University of Idaho.&nbsp; This will be a
  community project!

<div class="border-start ps-2 ms-3">
<p>How we at the University of Idaho define the characteristics and interplay
  of the unique and ubiquitous, of the outer manifest and inner transcendent can directly relate to our capacities for
  imagination, creativity and discovery, as well as result in levels of ambiguity,
  dissonance, and the &quot;mutually exclusive&quot; among our faculty and
  students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How we design our
  diversity/universality interplay relates to our capacities for communication and
  collaboration, and is fundamental to a climate of tolerance, civility, respect, empathy and nurturance experienced by
  all members of the Vandal
  community.&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p>
</div>
<div class="border-start ps-2 ms-5">
<p>The interplay certainly plays out in the
  theoretical tensions or possible integration between reductionist and grand-scale systems
  thinking, for example.</p>
<p>The interplay bears directly on the academic
  stress or accommodation between the disciplinarity of the &quot;silos&quot; and
  the trans-disciplinarity of the &quot;academy,&quot; for example.</p>
<p>The
  interplay is witnessed in the social intolerance or affirmed respect between
  varied ethnic, sexual-oriented or religious groups on campus, for example.
</p>
</div>
<div class="border-start ps-2 ms-3">
<p>And certainly, the interplay of the particular and unitary is fundamental to questions relating to how we build and
  sustain
  varied forms of community, both locally and
  globally.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>From the pedagogical design a college course, to the research
  design embedded in a National Science Foundation or National Endowment for the
  Humanities grant application, to the landscape design of our campus facilities
  and green space, we are all
  impacted by the characteristics and interplay of our human diversity and shared
  humanity.&nbsp; In reflection, in what ways has the
  interplay of the diverse and universal, and its varied extensions, impacted your
  own life?
</p>
</div>

<p> In so many ways, the
  interplay of our human diversity and shared humanity relates directly to our
  capacities for what it means to be human.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some &quot;big
  questions&quot; indeed.&nbsp; See <a href="questions.html">
    <strong>Questions</strong></a> on how these issues are further developed and
  articulated.&nbsp;&nbsp; All this is not to suggest that there are not other
  implications to be discovered in our Humanities Exploration.&nbsp; Let's see
  what awaits?&nbsp;</p>
<p> As a result of this Humanities Exploration may we be able
  better to understand, appreciate, critique and contribute to the various &quot;interplays&quot;
  expressed in our many interrelationships and communities, be they at, within or beyond the University of
  Idaho.&nbsp;
