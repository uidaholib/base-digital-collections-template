Idaho's Women of Influence project welcomes submissions and corrections from the public to make this resource better!

New database entries may be submitted online by librarians, educators, museum staff, tribal authorities, women's organizations, or others researching this area.
Each entry must be accompanied by one to five published or otherwise publicly available sources of information. 

Contributors to the database are also encouraged to create or update [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) articles on the women as well.

New contributions can be made by emailing the information to Special Collections and Archives at <libspec@uidaho.edu>.
