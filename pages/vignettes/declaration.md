# Declaration of Independence
## July 4, 1776

The Declaration of Independence represents a pivotal moment where particular colonial grievances were transformed into universal principles of human rights and self-governance, creating a document that continues to resonate across cultures and centuries.

## The Universal and the Particular

This foundational document demonstrates the wheel metaphor in its very structure and arguments:

**Universal principles** (the hub):
- "All men are created equal"
- Unalienable rights to "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"
- Government derives power from "consent of the governed"
- Right of people to "alter or abolish" destructive governments

**Particular grievances** (the spokes):
- Specific complaints against King George III and British Parliament
- Colonial experiences of taxation without representation
- Violations of particular legal and economic rights
- Historical context of 1776 American colonial situation

## The Complete Text

### In Congress, July 4, 1776

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

### Core Principles

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

### Specific Grievances

Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

[The document continues with 18 specific grievances against King George III, including:]

- He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
- He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance...
- He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices...
- He has cut off our Trade with all parts of the world...
- He has imposed Taxes on us without our Consent...
- He has deprived us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury...

### Appeals and Final Declaration

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us...

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES...

## Reflection on the Wheel Metaphor

The Declaration demonstrates how particular experiences (colonial grievances) can give rise to universal principles (human rights) that continue to inspire movements for justice worldwide. The document's enduring power lies in its ability to connect specific historical circumstances to timeless ideals about human dignity and self-governance.

How do the particular circumstances of 1776 America relate to universal principles of human rights? In what ways have these principles been applied, challenged, or expanded in different cultural and historical contexts?
