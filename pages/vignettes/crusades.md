# The Crusades

The Crusades represent a complex interplay between particular religious motivations and universal claims to sacred space, where diverse groups clashed over competing visions of spiritual authority and territorial control.

## Reflection

This historical painting depicts a moment where particular cultural and religious identities collided in pursuit of universal sacred spaces. The Crusades demonstrate how the wheel metaphor can break down when spokes claim exclusive access to the hub, rather than recognizing multiple paths to the sacred.

The image shows three significant religious sites:
- **The Holy Sepulchre** - Christian sacred space
- **The Dome of the Rock** - Islamic sacred space  
- **The Ramparts** - Military fortifications representing temporal power

Each represents different spokes on the wheel of religious experience, yet the historical moment captured shows conflict rather than the harmonious turning that Tom Yellowtail envisioned.
