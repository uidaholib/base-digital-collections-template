# As Above, So Below - As a Drop in an Endless Ocean
## Examples of the Non-Dualistic Hindu View

The Hindu philosophical tradition offers a profound example of the wheel metaphor through its understanding of how individual diversity (the many) relates to universal unity (the One). The principle "As above, so below" suggests that the cosmic order is reflected in human structure and experience.

## Cosmic Levels (The Universal)

The cosmos operates at multiple interconnected levels, from the infinite to the temporal:

### **Infinite Level**
- **Brahman** - The pervasive, ultimate reality underlying all existence

### **Celestial Level**  
- **Trimurti** - The three aspects of divine consciousness (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva)
- **Gods and Goddesses** - Various manifestations of divine energy and consciousness

### **Intermediate Level**
- **Ghosts and departed souls in limbo** - Transitional states of consciousness
- **The psychokinetic world** - Realm of mental and spiritual forces

### **Terrestrial Level**
- **Natural, physical, finite, temporal world** - What we experience as material reality
- **Maya** - The "illusion" or veil that makes the unified appear separate

## Human Levels (The Particular)

Each individual human mirrors this cosmic structure through parallel levels of being:

### **Body Level**
- **Biological, physical, finite, temporal senses** - Our material interface with the world

### **Mind Level**
- **Ideas, personality and gunas** - Mental formations and character traits
- **Gunas** - The three fundamental qualities (sattva, rajas, tamas) that shape experience

### **Soul Level**
- **Unique jivas** - Individual souls with distinct karmic patterns and experiences

### **Spirit Level**
- **Atman** - The pervasive universal consciousness present in each being

## The Wheel Metaphor in Hindu Philosophy

This non-dualistic view demonstrates the wheel metaphor perfectly:

**The spokes** (diversity):
- Individual souls (jivas) with unique experiences
- Different levels of consciousness and awareness
- Varied personalities, talents, and life paths
- Multiple gods, goddesses, and spiritual practices

**The hub** (unity):
- Brahman as the underlying reality of all existence
- Atman as the universal consciousness in all beings
- The recognition that individual soul and universal spirit are one

**The turning wheel**:
- The process of spiritual evolution and realization
- The gradual recognition that individual diversity and universal unity are not separate
- The journey from experiencing separation (maya) to recognizing unity

## The Drop and the Ocean

The metaphor of a drop of water in an endless ocean beautifully illustrates this relationship:

- Each **drop** (individual) has a unique shape, position, and apparent separateness
- Yet each drop is made of the same **water** (consciousness) as the entire ocean
- When the drop recognizes its true nature, it realizes it was never separate from the ocean
- The ocean gains fullness through the presence of countless unique drops
- Each drop reflects the entire ocean while maintaining its particular perspective

## Reflection

How does this Hindu understanding of cosmic and human parallels relate to the wagon wheel metaphor? In what ways might recognizing the "Atman" (universal consciousness) within ourselves change how we relate to human diversity?

If we are all "drops in the endless ocean" of consciousness, how does this affect our understanding of individual rights, cultural differences, and social justice? Does recognizing unity eliminate the importance of diversity, or does it provide a foundation for celebrating differences?
