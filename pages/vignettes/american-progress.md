This iconic 1872 painting embodies the complex intersection of particular cultural moment and universal human themes of progress, expansion, and the relationship between civilization and nature.

## The Vision of Manifest Destiny

George Crofutt's description of Gast's painting, which accompanied this widely distributed image, captures the particular ideology of American expansion:

> "In John Gast's 'American Progress,' a diaphanously and precariously clad American floats westward thru the air with the 'Star of Empire' on her forehead. She has left the cities of the East behind, and the wide Mississippi, and still her course is westward. In her right hand she carries a school book, testimonial of the National Enlightenment, while with her left hand she trails the slender wires of the telegraph that will bind the nation. Fleeing her approach are Indians, buffalo, wild horses, bears, and other game, disappearing into the storm and waves of the Pacific Coast. They flee the wondrous vision - the Star 'is too much for them.'"

## Romanticism and Universal Themes

This painting follows the tradition of **Romanticism** which began in Europe in the mid-19th century, connecting it to universal themes found across cultures:

**European Romantic tradition**:
- Eugène Delacroix's "Liberty Leading the People" (1830)
- Victor Hugo's "Les Misérables" (1863)
- James Fenimore Cooper's frontier novels

**Universal themes in romantic imagery**:
- The personification of abstract ideals (Progress, Liberty)
- The tension between civilization and nature
- The heroic individual or nation advancing against obstacles
- The visual representation of cultural destiny and identity

## The Wheel Metaphor and Expansion

This painting complicates the wheel metaphor by showing what happens when one spoke claims dominance over others:

**Multiple perspectives** (different spokes):
- **European-American perspective**: Progress, enlightenment, technological advancement
- **Indigenous perspective**: Displacement, cultural destruction, invasion
- **Environmental perspective**: The cost of expansion on natural ecosystems
- **Universal human perspective**: The drive to explore, settle, and transform landscapes

**The "hub" question**: What universal human values or needs might all these perspectives point toward? Security? Growth? Connection to place? The challenge is finding ways for different spokes to coexist rather than one driving out the others.

## Reflection

How do we understand "progress"? Gast's painting celebrates technological and territorial expansion, but from other perspectives this same movement represents loss and destruction. 

How might the wheel metaphor help us envision forms of progress that honor multiple spokes - Indigenous wisdom, environmental sustainability, technological advancement, and cultural diversity - rather than advancing one at the expense of others?

What does it mean to carry both "the school book" of education and "the telegraph wires" of communication in ways that connect rather than displace?
