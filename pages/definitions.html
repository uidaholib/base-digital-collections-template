<p><b><a style="color:#000"  name="humanities">The Humanities and its Disciplines</a>.</b>The humanities are academic disciplines
that seek to understand, appreciate and critique the human conduction in all its
depth and range of meaning.&nbsp; They, in varied ways, consider the
&quot;big questions,&quot; both of the contemporary and the perennial, and with
these understandings and methodologies engage civic life, both locally and
globally, to address the challenges faced by humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p >
While there are many other disciplines that
also seek to understand the human condition, the approaches and methodologies of
the humanities are
primarily interpretive (analytical, critical, and/or reflective), as distinguished
from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural and social sciences, and the
creative approaches in the arts. </p>
<p >
The second distinction is in what the 
humanities then attempt to do with the knowledge generated, in the 
application of understanding. The Idaho Humanities Council goes on to say, "through [the] study [of the humanities 
it seeks to] yield wisdom." As written in the 1965 National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act which 
established the National Endowment for the Humanities and all the state 
councils, Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens." Wisdom is that deep understanding that goes beyond knowing to 
application, engaging civic life, both locally and globally, to address the 
challenges faced by humanity.  To take up the 
"big questions." </p>
<p>In his keynote address, Gary Williams, 
my predecessor in this role of Distinguished Humanities Professor, emphasized 
that the Humanities are ". . . a way of thinking 
about and responding to the world " tools we use to examine and make 
sense of the human experience in general and our individual experiences 
in particular. The humanities enable us to reflect upon our lives and ask 
fundamental questions of value, purpose, and meaning in a rigorous and 
systematic way" (Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities).&nbsp;&nbsp; As the 1965 Congressional Act stressed, the term 'humanities' pays "particular attention to 
our diverse heritage, traditions, and history and to the relevance of the humanities to the current 
conditions of national life" . . . . to both the particular and diverse, 
as well as the national and general "shared in common."&nbsp;  Attempting to address the "big questions."</p>

<p >The humanities disciplines typically
include anthropology/ethnography, communications studies, cultural studies (such
as American, Black, International, Latin
    American, Native American, Religious,&nbsp; Women's Studies), languages,
law, literature, history, philosophy, and reflection and theory in creative
writing, in the performing arts of music, dance and theatre,
and in the visual arts of painting, sculpting and architecture.</p>

<p >According
to the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/legislation.html">1965 National
Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act</a>, &quot;The term 'humanities'
includes, but is not limited to, the study of the following: language, both
modern and classical; linguistics; literature; history; jurisprudence;
philosophy; archaeology; comparative religion; ethics; the history, criticism
and theory of the arts; those aspects of social sciences which have humanistic
content and employ humanistic methods; and the study and application of the
humanities to the human environment with particular attention to reflecting <i> our
diverse heritage, traditions, and history</i>  and to the relevance of the humanities
to the current conditions of <em>national life</em>&quot; (emphasis added), to 
both the unique and diverse as well as the national and shared in common.&nbsp; (from National Endowment for
the Humanities website, <a href="http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/overview.html">An Overview of the NEH</a>).

<p ><b><a style="color:#000"  name="narratives">Narratives</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>
The humanities landscape upon 
which we'll travel and explore the interplay of our human diversity and shared 
humanity will be through varied forms of narratives.&nbsp; &quot;Narrative&quot; will be defined 
broadly,
entailing some sort of storyline and integrated

paradigm of more or less coherent thought and action, all premised on certain ontological 
principles and expressed through certain symbolic languages.&nbsp; These 
ontological principles could include some form of dualism or monism, and materialism,
idealism or animism among other principles, for instance.&nbsp; The 
symbolic languages include prose, poetry, 
mathematics, architecture, painting, dance and music, among others.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Examples of narratives can range from such mega-narratives such as <a href="resources.html" target="_blank">Christianity</a> and <a href="resources.html" target="_blank">Science</a>, 
to specific aesthetic narratives such as <a href="PDF/Cubism.pdf" target="exteranl">Cubism</a> and<a href="Gast%20Landscape.html" target="_blank"> 
Romanticism</a>, as well as a <a href="YinLandscape.html" target="_blank">Taoist Landscape

<b><a style="color:#000"  name="diversity">Characteristics of the Unique-the Spokes and Universal-the Rim/Hub</a>.</b>&nbsp;
For the purposes of this humanities exploration, just how "human
diversity" and the many spokes, as well as "shared humanity" and the hub
and rim are defined will be left open, expressive the widest possible range of
human characteristics.&nbsp; No single metaphor or set of attributes will 
ultimately serve us well. <p >  
Human diversity certainly covers familiar characteristics involving gender, 
race, and ethnicity as well as characteristics of religion, sexual orientation, 
age, class, ability and culture. &nbsp;It entails the varied ways individuals and 
groups are distinct in meaningful ways at the local, national and global levels 
of human society.&nbsp;&nbsp; And beyond these social distinctions, diversity 
can also refer to differentiated ways of aesthetic, epistemological, literary, 
psychological, and spatial thought and expression, including disciplinarity, 
exclusivity,
the idiosyncratic, the finite and differentiated hinterland, for example. </p><p >
 
 On the other hand, shared humanity transcends the idiosyncratic in the human 
	experience and entails characteristics involving universality and 
	commonality.&nbsp; Beyond these characteristics, shared humanity can also 
	refer to inclusivity, trans-disciplinarity, the nomothetic, the
 infinite and eternal, and the center and the <i>axis mundi</i>.&nbsp; We might look at the &quot;hub&quot; as referring to the
    universality we share with one another, while the &quot;rim&quot; refers to
    some sort of integration or assemblage of the diverse parts under an
    inclusive, single umbrella.&nbsp; 
	As these are characteristics that can be infused with abstract, affective, 
	ethereal, and/or esoteric qualities and significances, they can be the most difficult to 
	analytically articulate into words.&nbsp;&nbsp; And certainly, there may not 
	even be a consensus on what are &quot;universals.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may 
	not all hold the same conviction that there are &quot;certain inalienable rights; 
	that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&quot; 
	or &quot;nonomaterials and subatomic particles&quot; or &quot;Mind&quot; or a &quot;Life-Force and
 Spirit&quot; that defines the ubiquitous 
	in our shared humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p><p >
 And finally, there are no sharp, precise 
	demarcations between these possible characteristics of the spokes and hub/rim, 
	as would be suggested in the diagram below.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such divisions are often 
	blurred, the qualities of each imbued in the other, as in the example of the
	<a href="yin_yang.html">Yin Yang</a>.&nbsp; There can even be a sort of three-dimensional overlay 
	of 
	characteristics, as with, for example, both the overt manifestation and 
	inner transcendent overlaying and embedded within both the individual and 
	the collective.&nbsp; It is conceptually not 
	unlike attempting to discern the beginning and ending points of the single 
	line in 
	the <a href="PDF/The%20Mobius%20Strip%20and%20Inclusivity.pdf">Mobius Strip</a>.</p><p>

<p ><b><a style="color:#000"  name="interplay">
Dynamic Interplay between the Unique and Universal</a>.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; There
are certainly multiple ways of thinking about and acting out the interplay
between the distinct, unique and finite, and the inclusive, universal and eternal qualities of our
lives, between our human diversity and shared humanity.&nbsp; The <b>Wagon
Wheel</b> is but one approach.&nbsp; As suggested by <a href="origin.html">Tom Yellowtail</a>,
the Wagon Wheel narrative acknowledges the importance and viability of each differentiated
spoke, be it of a social, religious or some other cognitive or behavioral
category, and of maintaining the equality of each relative to the others.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, all spokes are united by an anchoring hub and all-embracing rim,
by some form of universality shared by all.&nbsp; For Yellowtail this 
appreciation
allowed him to successfully travel the many distinct spokes in his life,
without conflict, a balancing of the turning wheel.&nbsp;&nbsp; He could as 
easily engage and speak with a Buddhist monk, a Baptist minister, a medical 
doctor, as with a Sundancer. &nbsp;</p><p >
We see a
similar approach to diversity and universality in <strong>Hinduism</strong>.&nbsp; While there are many 
different religious
paths or <em>yogas</em> expressed in the religion, for example <em>Bhakti,</em>&nbsp;<em>Jnana</em>, <em>Karma</em>
and <em>Raja Yogas</em>, and while there are literally millions of distinct manifest Gods and
Goddesses within whom each individual can find affiliation (spokes), nevertheless, all
the Gods and Goddesses are subsumed within the ultimate divinity of a singular omnipresent
Brahman and all the <em>yogas</em> inevitably lead to the same Infinite bliss, 
<em>Moksha</em>
(hub and rim).&nbsp;</p><p >We will 
also recognize that the Wheel has a fundamental similarity with 
the <a href="yin_yang.html" target="_blank"><strong>Taoism and Yin Yang</strong></a> 
narrative. &nbsp; Ultimately each emanates out of a monism - for Taoism, 
the nameless Tao, and for the Aps&aacute;alooke, the varied-named Creator.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Nevertheless, both manifest the myriad expressions of reality beginning with a 
binary - for Taoism, the Yin Yang, and for Tom Yellowtail, the hub/rim and 
spokes.&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast with the critique of Western Philosophy and 
indeed Western Civilization by some, the Tao and Aps&aacute;alooke binaries are neither 
oppositional or hierarchical, and hence not hegemonic.&nbsp; Interdependent, balanced complementarity highlights these binaries.</span>.</p><p >In
this dynamic interplay I don't think Yellowtail assumes a static, intransigent nature in
the Wheel's spokes and their interplay.&nbsp;&nbsp; New spokes are added
to the wheel, while others dissipate.&nbsp; Yellowtail effectively traveled a
spoke, that of Christianity, his distant forefathers had not known.&nbsp; One
additive process, for example, can entail syncretism.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp; Syncretism</b>
is the blending of characteristics from distinctly separate spokes into an 
integrated single new spoke, as exemplified in American blues and jazz, the blending of
  elements from distinctly African and American musical traditions to form a new
  tradition.&nbsp; And it might be argued that on a micro level this ability to
transcend the idiosyncrasies of one's own spoke and freely envision and then
reconfigure characteristics from distinctly separate spokes, of going beyond the 
overt manifest forms into the inner reaches of transcendent realms, that goes to the heart of
the processes of<b> discovery</b> and <b>creativity</b>.&nbsp; And with 
discovery comes the possibility of new spokes and the deletion of
&quot;out-dated&quot; others, as the scientific cosmos of Ptolemy was replaced by that of Copernicus 
and Newton, and, in turn, perhaps replaced by that of quantum mechanics and chaos
theory.&nbsp; And with creativity comes the possibility of new spokes
supplementing existing spokes, as the 
artistic world of 19th century Neo-Classicism was followed by Realism, by 
Romanticism, by 
Impressionism, by Cubism, by Surrealism, by Abstract Expressionism, by . . . .</p><p >In
an initial review of a few other ways of approaching the interplay of our human diversity
and shared humanity there can also be very different outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
need to be able to critically critique the interplay,&nbsp; as much as celebrate 
it.&nbsp; Take for example the following.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p ><b>Compartmentalization</b>
  - the exclusive separation of the spokes, without any form of integration between them, as exemplified in the schisms of the contemporary &quot;culture
  wars&quot; between conservatives and progressives, or even in the academy
  between the humanities and sciences disciplines, and between positivists and
  postmodernists, and, at a more insidious level, in the history
of segregation in the United States and of apartheid in South Africa.</p><p ><b>Assimilation
  </b>- the dominance of one spoke resulting in the incorporation of another
  spoke within it, as exemplified in the intentions of the European Christian Inquisitions and
  Crusades toward &quot;heretics&quot; and &quot;infidels&quot; beginning in the
  12th century, in the federal policies of the United States toward the indigenous
  populations of North American in 19th and early 20th centuries, in the religious fundamentalism expressed in many religions throughout the world
  today, and even in the academy as expressed in &quot;scientism.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p ><b>Extinction</b>
  - the dominance of one spoke resulting in the elimination of another, as
  exemplified in the policies of Nazi Germany toward Jews and
  other minorities during the 1930s - 40s, and in the Rwanda
Genocide of 1994.
</blockquote>
</p><p >In contrast 
with the Wheel approach, the above three
instances seem to be orientations that focus on the spokes alone, devoid of a hub/rim 
consideration.&nbsp; And in addition, any acknowledgement of some sort of equality between the spokes
is dismissed or even challenged, and any sort of a shared humanity, any sort of
hub/rim, seems
implicitly or explicitly understood as something exclusively embedded only within &quot;their&quot;
particular spoke.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we likely find the binaries as 
oppositional and hierarchical, with their hegemonic results.</p><p >Certainly 
there are other approaches to the interplay between our human diversity and 
shared humanity.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like Tom Yellowtail's Wheel, these approaches are often 
expressed in some sort of narrative or theoretical paradigm, a storyline that 
accounts for and integrates, in some fashion, the diverse and the universal.&nbsp; 
Beyond the Wagon Wheel, there is a range of the diversity/universality 
interplay, from some sort of oppositional dualism and antithesis at one end, 
while at the other end, some sort of complementary and integral binary.&nbsp; </p><p>In 
the <a href="resources.html">
<strong>Resource</strong></a> section there are additional examples on the interplay found in the stories and images from various world
traditions, including that of Christianity and Science.&nbsp; What other approaches to the interplay between our human
diversity and shared humanity might there be?&nbsp;&nbsp; Join us in adding them to our humanities
exploration.&nbsp;&nbsp;
