This page outlines the key concepts and frameworks that underpin the "Turning of the Wheel" humanities exploration.

## 1. The Humanities

The humanities are academic disciplines that seek to understand, appreciate and critique the human condition in all its depth and range of meaning. They consider the "big questions" both contemporary and perennial through primarily interpretive approaches (analytical, critical, reflective) rather than empirical (sciences) or creative (arts).

Through study, the humanities seek to yield **wisdom** - deep understanding that goes beyond knowing to application. As stated in the National Endowment for the Humanities Act: "Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens."

**Humanities disciplines include:**
- Anthropology/Ethnography
- Communications Studies
- Cultural Studies
- Languages
- Law
- Literature
- History
- Philosophy
- Reflection/Theory in Creative Writing and Performing/Visual Arts

## 2. Narratives

Narratives are broadly defined as having some sort of storyline and integrated paradigm of coherent thought and action. They are based on ontological principles (dualism, monism, materialism, idealism, animism) and expressed through symbolic languages (prose, poetry, mathematics, architecture, painting, dance, music).

**Examples of narratives range from:**
- **Mega-narratives**: Christianity, Science
- **Aesthetic narratives**: Cubism, Romanticism
- **Specific cultural expressions**: Plato's Cave, Plains Indian Tipi, Catholic Cathedral

## 3. Characteristics of the Unique and Universal

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h3>Unique/Spokes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Human diversity</strong>: gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, age, class, ability, culture</li>
      <li><strong>Communities</strong>: local, individual, micro, self, soul</li>
      <li><strong>Language</strong>: vernacular</li>
      <li><strong>Approach</strong>: exclusivity, dualism, disciplinarity, reductionist</li>
      <li><strong>Character</strong>: particular, singular, idiosyncratic</li>
      <li><strong>Temporal</strong>: finite, immediate</li>
      <li><strong>Spatial</strong>: differentiated hinterland</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h3>Universal/Hub and Rim</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shared humanity</strong>: universality, commonality, trans-cultural</li>
      <li><strong>Communities</strong>: global, collective, macro, the Absolute, the Divine</li>
      <li><strong>Language</strong>: lingua franca</li>
      <li><strong>Approach</strong>: inclusivity, monism, trans-disciplinarity, holistic</li>
      <li><strong>Character</strong>: universal, unitary, ubiquitous, nomothetic</li>
      <li><strong>Temporal</strong>: infinite/eternal, perennial</li>
      <li><strong>Spatial</strong>: center/axis mundi</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<strong>Note:</strong> There are no sharp demarcations between these characteristics - they often blur and overlap in complex ways.

## 4. The Interplay

### Wagon Wheel Approach
The wagon wheel metaphor acknowledges the importance of each differentiated spoke while maintaining equality among them. All spokes are united by an anchoring hub and an all-embracing rim.

### Similar Approaches
- **Hinduism**: Different yogas leading to the same Moksha
- **Taoism**: Yin Yang balance and interdependence

### Dynamic Nature
The interplay is not static - new spokes are added while others dissipate. This dynamic process includes:
- Syncretism
- Discovery
- Creativity
- Cultural evolution

### Negative Interplays
When the balance fails, problematic patterns emerge:
- **Compartmentalization**: Exclusive separation without connection
- **Assimilation**: Dominance of one spoke over others
- **Extinction**: Elimination of other spokes entirely

*These definitions provide the conceptual foundation for understanding how the unique and universal interact in human experience, offering a framework for exploring diversity and commonality through the humanities.*
