    <p class="lead">These questions are designed to guide our exploration of the interplay between the unique and universal. They invite investigation, reflection, and dialogue rather than providing definitive answers.</p>

## 1. Application of a Metaphor

Can Yellowtail's Wagon Wheel metaphor be meaningfully extended to society and humanities engagement? Are there other applicable metaphors from different cultural traditions that might serve similar purposes?

---

## 2. Diversity and Universality in the Humanities

How do humanities disciplines understand, appreciate, communicate, and celebrate both human diversity and shared humanity? What methods and approaches do different fields use to engage with these concepts?

---

## 3. Dynamic Interplay

How have the humanities historically informed the interplay between diversity and universality? How do we know one from the other? What are the markers and boundaries, and how do they shift over time?

---

## 4. Social Diversity and Commonality

How do we maintain balance given the complex social categories of:
- Gender
- Race
- Ethnicity
- Religion
- Sexual orientations
- Age
- Class
- Ability

What happens when these categories intersect and overlap?

---

## 5. Disciplinarity and Interdisciplinarity

How do we engage in meaningful cross-disciplinary collaboration despite differing:
- Communication modes and vocabularies
- Pedagogical approaches
- Research methodologies
- Theoretical frameworks

---

## 6. Exclusivity and Inclusivity

Must we give up what once was to become something new? Consider these examples:
- An American Indian student navigating traditional identity while pursuing higher education
- A literature professor becoming an ethnographer
- A community adapting to demographic changes

---

## 7. Idiosyncratic and Nomothetic

How do we reconcile differentiated, idiosyncratic experiences with the search for normality, consistency, and generalizable patterns? How do we honor individual uniqueness while seeking common ground?

---

## 8. Finite and Infinite/Eternal

What is our place in the cosmos? How do we reconcile our finite self with the boundless infinite? What are the implications for meaning-making and purpose?

---

## 9. Communications Technology

How have rapidly changing technologies and social media impacted:
- Human diversity and cultural expression
- Shared humanity and global connection
- The balance between local and global identities
- The speed and nature of cultural change

---

## 10. Communication and Collaboration

What are the implications of our understanding of unique/universal interplay for our capacities for:
- **Communication** across differences
- **Collaboration** despite diverse perspectives
- **Tolerance** for ambiguity and complexity
- **Respect** for different ways of knowing
- **Empathy** across cultural boundaries
- **Creativity** in problem-solving
- **Intellectual curiosity** about others
- **Wisdom** in decision-making

---

## 11. Humanities Disciplines

How have specific humanities disciplines attempted to grapple with the diversity of spokes and universality of hub/rim? What can we learn from:
- Anthropology's approach to cultural relativism and human universals
- Literature's exploration of particular stories and universal themes
- Philosophy's search for fundamental principles and contextual applications
- History's balance between specific events and broader patterns
- Religious studies' engagement with diverse traditions and common spiritual questions

---

## 12. The Exploration

How can this series equip participants to discover their own meaning of:
- The spokes (their unique identities and perspectives)
- The hub/rim (their connection to broader humanity)
- The turning Wagon Wheel (the dynamic interplay between the two)

What tools, insights, and experiences will be most valuable for this ongoing exploration?

*These questions are meant to be lived with rather than simply answered. They invite ongoing exploration, dialogue, and the discovery of new questions that emerge from our collective engagement with the complexities of human diversity and shared humanity.*
