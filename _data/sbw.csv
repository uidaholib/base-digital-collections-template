sbw119,The Selway Patrol,"The Selway Patrol, is an exceptional document. Produced in 1912, it records in detail the conditions of various territories within the Selway National Forest. What is most striking about this document, though, is not the range of its information but the quality of its prose. When compared with more modern documents written by the Forest Service, The Selway Patrol is both poetic and philosophical, making at times grand statements about nature and its conservation. Please see especially the introduction and, also, the poem on the final page, A Tribute to the Forest Ranger by A. Strohecker of the U. S. Geological Survey. by Fenn, Frank; Shank, Ernest; Strohecker, A. , U. S. Geological Survey. Date: 1912-02-01",,"Fenn, Frank; Shank, Ernest; Strohecker, A.",U. S.

Both the Forest Service and local citizens feel a sense of ownership, but poised in opposition directions. Whereas the Forest Service is interested in improving access to wilderness, local inhabitants of the Clearwater Valley feel the wildlife in this area is theirs because of location, and resent the fact that roads though the Bitterroot make it more accessible . . .
