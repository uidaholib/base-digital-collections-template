Chute meets Flume [02],,Winston Lumber Company Falls Creek Chute and Flume. According to Dick Reed this was a running chute most of the time  but a man and horse were kept near the junction in case the logs stopped before they got to the flume. Generally the logs entered the flume of their own momentum. Note the tow path to the left of the junction. The white spot is a plume of water thrown up when the log from the chute plunged into the water in the flume. You can also see another log in the chute about ready to hit the flume.
