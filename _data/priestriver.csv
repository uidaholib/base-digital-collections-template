Gus Naccarato was the logger for Humbird Lumber Co. The man in the white sweater at the left standing on logs toward the top of the stack was Earl Clintsman. According to Foss, log drives on the West Branch ended in 1931 after the big fire because Humbird went out of business. Logs were pulled from the pile into the river for the log drive by an old Fordson tractor. When I showed this pix to Chuck Peterson, he said the had never seen logs piled like this in this country before. Logs here were decked; they were much easier to get at that way.
